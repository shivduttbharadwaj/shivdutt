		<Title>MS15-013: Vulnerability in Microsoft Office Could Allow Security Feature Bypass - Office 2013 Gold - KB2910941</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This patch has been partially superseded by MS16-029. Whereas this Fixlet previously applied to Office 2013 Gold/SP1, it now only applies to Office 2013 Gold.</P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The vulnerability could allow security feature bypass if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this security feature bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to run arbitrary code.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2910941.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
