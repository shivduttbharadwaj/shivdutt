		<Title>MS00-097: Severed Windows Media Server Connection Vulnerability</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
Microsoft has released a bulletin announcing a vulnerability in Windows Media Services. When a connection is made and released with the Unicast Server portion of WMS using a specific sequence of packets, WMS does not release all of the allocated resources. An attacker could connect and release many times in a row, degrading system performance until the resources became exhausted. This patch also eliminates previous vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled. <BR><BR><b>Note: </b>After the patch has finished installing, a dialogue will appear asking that the computer be restarted.<BR><BR><b>File Size: </b>649 KB<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This security update is also referenced under KB265714.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This Fixlet message does not have a default action. For more information on default actions, see BigFix KB #474.
