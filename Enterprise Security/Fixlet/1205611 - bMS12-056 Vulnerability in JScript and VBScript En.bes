		<Title>MS12-056: Vulnerability in JScript and VBScript Engines Could Allow Remote Code Execution - JScript 5.8 and VBScript 5.8 - Windows Server 2008 R2 Gold (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This patch has been partially superseded by KB3094995. Whereas this Fixlet previously applied to Windows Server 2008 R2 Gold/SP1 (x64), it now only applies to Windows Server 2008 R2 Gold (x64).</P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the JScript and VBScript scripting engines on 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user visited a specially crafted website. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2706045.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
