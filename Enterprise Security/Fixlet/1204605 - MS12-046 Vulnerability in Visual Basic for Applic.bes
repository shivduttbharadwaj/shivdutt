		<Title>MS12-046: Vulnerability in Visual Basic for Applications Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Office 2010 Gold/SP1</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a legitimate Microsoft Office file (such as a .docx file) that is located in the same directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts that have full user rights. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2598243.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
