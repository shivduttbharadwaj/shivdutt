		<Title>MS02-044: Unsafe Functions in Office Web Components</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><FONT size=2>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a security vulnerability in the Microsoft Office Web Components (OWC), which are included with many Microsoft products. Three vulnerabilities exist in the OWC which could allow an attacker to read files on the user's system, view the copy buffer of the user's system, or execute operating system commands as the user. After applying the patch the affected systems will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled. <BR><BR><B>Note</B>: Client machines may briefly display a command prompt window during installation of this update.<BR><BR><B>Note</B>: There are three Fixlet messages for this update which correspond to three versions of the patch. One version applies to Project 2002, the second to Project Server 2002, and the third to all other products that contain the Office Web Components. It is necessary to apply all relevant patches to each machine in order to provide complete protection from this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in Windows XP Service Pack 2.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Installation of this patch requires&nbsp;Bigfix Client interacting with Desktop. Please use Fixlet Message&nbsp;540 "Enable Bigfix Client Interacting with Desktop" in BES Support site to enable.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> BigFix has received reports of shutdown issues on Windows 9x machines associated with the installation of this patch. Please test this patch prior to deployment in a production environment.<BR><BR><B>File Size:</B> 4.19 MB</FONT><BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This Fixlet message does not have a default action.
