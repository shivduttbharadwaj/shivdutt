		<Title>MS07-026: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Microsoft Exchange 2003 SP2 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS07-026. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<br /><br />This update resolves several newly discovered, privately reported vulnerabilities. An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</P> <P>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</P> <P><STRONG>Note: </STRONG>The update for this issue may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P> <P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: red">Important Note:</SPAN> This update will stop and restart all affected Exchange 2003 services. Please schedule the update to occur at a time when a service interruption is acceptable.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
