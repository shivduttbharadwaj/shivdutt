		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security patch for Office 2000. This update resolves several newly-discovered, privately reported and public vulnerabilities. On vulnerable versions of Office, if a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client workstation.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Due to the way "msiexec" runs on Windows 9x/ME, this update must be installed manually, or you must switch the Office 2000 Deployment Method to "Network" or "Local". <br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB905646.<br><br><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for this Fixlet message because it does not have a deployment action. For more information on default actions, see BigFix KB #474.<br><br><div class="HideFromWebUI"><b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.</div></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
