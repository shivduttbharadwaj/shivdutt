		<Title>MS12-034: Combined Security Update for Microsoft Office, Windows, .NET Framework, and Silverlight - Office 2007 SP2/SP3</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves three publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and seven privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office, Microsoft Windows, the Microsoft .NET Framework, and Microsoft Silverlight. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted document or visits a malicious webpage that embeds TrueType font files. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2596792.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
