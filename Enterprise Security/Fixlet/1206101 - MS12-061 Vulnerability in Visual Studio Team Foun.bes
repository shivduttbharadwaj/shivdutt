		<Title>MS12-061: Vulnerability in Visual Studio Team Foundation Server Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2010 SP1</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Visual Studio Team Foundation Server. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if a user clicks a specially crafted link in an email message or browses to a webpage that is used to exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to perform these actions. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit a website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2719584.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
