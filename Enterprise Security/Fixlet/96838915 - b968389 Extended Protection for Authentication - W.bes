		<Title>968389: Extended Protection for Authentication - Windows Server 2008 Gold/SP2 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft is announcing the availability of a new feature, Extended Protection for Authentication, on the Windows platform. This feature enhances the protection and handling of credentials when authenticating network connections by using Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA). <BR><BR>The update itself does not directly provide protection against specific attacks such as credential forwarding, but allows applications to opt in to Extended Protection for Authentication. <P><FONT color=red><B>Important Note:</B></FONT>&nbsp; This fixlet contains multiple deployment actions. To specify whether Extended Protection for Authentication will be enabled or disabled on the client, apply the appropriate action.&nbsp; This feature must be manually enabled on the server on a service-by-service basis, including for telnet.&nbsp; Please see Microsoft Security Advisory <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/973811.mspx">973811</A> for details.</P> <P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp; Enabling Extended Protection on the client will cause additional registry keys to be set and NTLMv2 Authentication to be enabled. Please see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/239869">239869</A>&nbsp;for more information.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
