		<Title>MS13-044: Vulnerability in Microsoft Visio Could Allow Information Disclosure - Visio 2003 SP3 (Administrative Installation)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if a user opens a specially crafted Visio file. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise an affected system.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2810062. <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> In preparation for deploying this update through an Administrative Installation Point, you must apply this patch to all Administrative Installation Points in your network. For instructions on how to install this patch to your Administrative Installation Point, see the 'Security Update' section of the security bulletin.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Some Office updates will force the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.</P> <P><SPAN id=dashboardLink></SPAN> <SCRIPT type=text/javascript>var isEvansOrLater = '<?relevance if (exists property "datastore inspectors") then (True) else (False)?>' == 'True'?true:false; document.body.onload = SetOfficeOverviewLink; function SetOfficeOverviewLink() { try {if (isEvansOrLater) { dashboardLink.innerHTML = Relevance('(format "<?rxlat <b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the {0}.?>" + link "<?rxlat Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard?>" of bes wizard whose (dashboard id of it = "office_overview.ojo" AND id of site of it = 2) as string ) as string');} else { dashboardLink.innerHTML = EvaluateRelevance('"<b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the " & link "Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard" of bes wizard whose (dashboard id of it = "office_overview.ojo" AND id of site of it = 2) as string & "."');} } catch (e) {if (isEvansOrLater) { dashboardLink.innerHTML ='<?jxlat <b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.?>';} else { dashboardLink.innerHTML = '<b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.';} } } </SCRIPT> </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
