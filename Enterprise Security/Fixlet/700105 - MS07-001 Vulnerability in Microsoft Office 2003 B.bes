		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a security vulnerability in Office 2003 Multilingual User Interface Pack (MUI). This update resolves a newly discovered, publicly reported vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <br><br><b>Note:</b> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.<br><br><b>Note:</b> In preparation for deploying this update through an Administrative Installation Point, you must apply this patch to all Administrative Installation Points in your network. For instructions on how to install this patch to your Administrative Installation Point, see the 'Security Update' section of the security bulletin.<br><br><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for the Fixlet message because it requires additional preparation before deployment. For more information on default actions, see BigFix KB #474.<br><br><div class="HideFromWebUI"><b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.</div></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
