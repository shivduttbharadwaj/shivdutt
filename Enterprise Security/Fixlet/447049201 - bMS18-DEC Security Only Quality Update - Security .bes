<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><div class="kb-summary-section section"><br><p><span><span><span><span>This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework that could allow remote code execution when Microsoft .NET Framework doesn&#39;t validate input correctly. An attacker who successfully exploits&nbsp;this vulnerability could take control of an affected system. The&nbsp;attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts that use full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.</span></span></span></span></p><br><br><p><span><span><span><span>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to pass specific input to an application that uses susceptible .NET Framework methods.</span></span></span></span></p><br><br><p><span><span><span><span>This security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Framework validates input.</span></span></span></span></p><br>To learn more about this vulnerability, see <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8540" id="kb-link-2" managed-link="" target="_blank">Microsoft Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE-2018-8540</a>.</div><br><br><p><strong><span class="text-base">Important&nbsp;</span></strong>If you install a language pack after you install this update, you must reinstall this update.
