		<Title>MS05-046: Vulnerability in the Client Service for NetWare Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows Server 2003 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS05-046. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a security vulnerability in the NetWare Client. This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately-reported vulnerability. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Client Service for NetWare (CSNW). By default, CSNW is not installed on any affected operating system version. Only customers who manually installed CSNW could be vulnerable to this issue. The vulnerability is documented in the "Vulnerability Details" section of the security bulletin. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity. <BR><BR>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2. <BR>
