		<Title>MS01-056: "Unchecked Buffer" in Windows Media Player .ASF Processor - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS01-056. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) is a streaming media format supported by Windows Media Player. According to Microsoft, a vulnerability in the .ASF Processor could allow a malicious ASF file to cause Media Player to crash or allow an attacker to run code on the user's computer. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers will report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but the vulnerability will not be closed until the affected computer is restarted. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This patch is included in Windows 200 Service Pack 3.<BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 780 KB
