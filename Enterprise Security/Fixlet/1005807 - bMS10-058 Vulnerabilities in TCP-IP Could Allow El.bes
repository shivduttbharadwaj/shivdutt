		<Title>MS10-058: Vulnerabilities in TCP/IP Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - Windows Server 2008 Gold (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS11-064. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows&nbsp;Server 2008&nbsp;Gold/SP2 (x64), it now only applies to Windows Server 2008 Gold (x64).<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The more severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege due to an error in the processing of a specific input buffer. An attacker who is able to log on to the target system could exploit this vulnerability and run arbitrary code with system-level privileges. The attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
