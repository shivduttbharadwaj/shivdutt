		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS06-026. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released an update that resolves a newly discovered, privately reported vulnerability. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Graphics Rendering Engine because of the way that it handles Windows Metafile (WMF) images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted WMF image that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or opened a specially crafted attachment in e-mail. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><b><BR>Note: </b>Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><b>Important Note:</b> There are known issues associated with the installation of this patch. Please see the "Caveats" section of the security bulletin for more information.
