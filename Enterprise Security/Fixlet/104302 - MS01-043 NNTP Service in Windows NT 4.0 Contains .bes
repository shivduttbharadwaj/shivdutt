		<Title>MS01-043: NNTP Service in Windows NT 4.0 Contains Memory Leak - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS01-043. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch to eliminate a memory leak in the NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol) service in Windows NT 4.0. According to Microsoft, the service contains a memory leak in a routine that processes news postings of a particular construction. If an attacker sent a large number of posts, the server memory could be depleted to the point at which normal service would be disrupted. An affected server could be restored to normal service by stopping and starting the IISAdmin service. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers will report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but the vulnerability will not be closed until the affected computer is restarted.<BR><BR><b>Note: </b>Client machines may briefly display a command prompt window during installation of this update.<BR><BR><b>File Size: </b>1.08 MB
