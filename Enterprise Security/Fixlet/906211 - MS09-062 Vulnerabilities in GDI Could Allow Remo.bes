Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows Vista Gold/SP1, it now only applies to Windows Vista Gold.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows GDI+.

See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update&nbsp;will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB958869.<BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
