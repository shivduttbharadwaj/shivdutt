		<Title>MS14-082: Vulnerability in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Office 2013 Gold/SP1 - KB2726958</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a specially crafted file is opened in an affected edition of Microsoft Office. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2726958.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
