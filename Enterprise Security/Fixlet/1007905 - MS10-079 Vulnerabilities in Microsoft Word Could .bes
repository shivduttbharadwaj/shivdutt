		<Title>MS10-079: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Office Web Apps</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves eleven privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Word file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.</P> <P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></STRONG> Bigfix testing has confirmed that this patch applies to machines that don't necessarily agree with file versioning information in KB2346411. Please take extra caution to qualify this update in a test environment prior to use in a production environment.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for this Fixlet message due to known issues associated with the installation of this patch.
