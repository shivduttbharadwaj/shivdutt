<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><div class="kb-summary-section section"><br><p>This security update resolves an information disclosure vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework that could allow an attacker to access information in multi-tenant environments. The vulnerability is caused when .NET Framework is used in high-load/high-density network connections in which content from one stream can blend into another stream.</p><br><br><p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker who can access one tenant in a high-load/high-density environment could potentially trigger multi-tenanted data exposure from one customer to another.</p><br><br><p>This security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that .NET Framework handles high-load/high-density network connections.</p><br>To learn more about this vulnerability, see <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8360" id="kb-link-2" target="">Microsoft Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE-2018-8360</a>.</div><br><p><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</p><p><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.</p><p><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB4345679.</p></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
