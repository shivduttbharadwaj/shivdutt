		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by KB2992611. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows Server 2008 R2 Gold/SP1 (x64), it now only applies to Windows Server 2008 R2 Gold (x64).</P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in TLS. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if an attacker intercepts encrypted web traffic served from an affected system. All cipher suites that do not use CBC mode are not affected.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2655992.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
