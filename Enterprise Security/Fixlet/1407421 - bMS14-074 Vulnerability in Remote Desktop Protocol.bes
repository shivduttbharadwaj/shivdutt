		<Title>MS14-074: Vulnerability in Remote Desktop Protocol Could Allow Security Feature Bypass - Windows Server 2008 SP2 - KB3003743 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow security feature bypass when Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) fails to properly log audit events. By default, RDP is not enabled on any Windows operating system. Systems that do not have RDP enabled are not at risk.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3003743.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
