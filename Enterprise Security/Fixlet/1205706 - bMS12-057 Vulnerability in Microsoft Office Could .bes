		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted file or embeds a specially crafted Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) graphics file into an Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2596754. <P><B>Note:</B> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.</P> <P><SPAN id=dashboardLink></SPAN> <SCRIPT type=text/javascript>var isEvansOrLater = '<?relevance if (exists property "datastore inspectors") then (True) else (False)?>' == 'True'?true:false; document.body.onload = SetOfficeOverviewLink; function SetOfficeOverviewLink() { try {if (isEvansOrLater) { dashboardLink.innerHTML = Relevance('(format "<?rxlat <b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the {0}.?>" + link "<?rxlat Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard?>" of bes wizard whose (dashboard id of it = "office_overview.ojo" AND id of site of it = 2) as string ) as string');} else { dashboardLink.innerHTML = EvaluateRelevance('"<b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the " & link "Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard" of bes wizard whose (dashboard id of it = "office_overview.ojo" AND id of site of it = 2) as string & "."');} } catch (e) {if (isEvansOrLater) { dashboardLink.innerHTML ='<?jxlat <b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.?>';} else { dashboardLink.innerHTML = '<b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.';} } } </SCRIPT> </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
