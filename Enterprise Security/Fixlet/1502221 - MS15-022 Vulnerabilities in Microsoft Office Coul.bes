		<Title>MS15-022: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution - SharePoint Server 2013 Gold - KB2760554 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This patch has been partially superseded by KB3172532. Whereas this Fixlet previously applied to SharePoint Server 2013 Gold/SP1 (x64), it now only applies to SharePoint Server 2013 Gold (x64).</P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2760554.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
