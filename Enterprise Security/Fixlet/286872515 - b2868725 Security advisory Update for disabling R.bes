		<Title>2868725: Security advisory: Update for disabling RC4 - Enable Workaround (Completely disable RC4)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><p> Clients and servers that do not want to use RC4 regardless of the other party's supported ciphers can disable RC4 cipher suites completely by setting the following registry keys. In this manner, any server or client that is talking to a client or server that must use RC4 can prevent a connection from occurring. Clients that deploy this setting will be unable to connect to sites that require RC4, and servers that deploy this setting will be unable to service clients that must use RC4. </p> <ul> <li>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Ciphers\RC4 128/128] "Enabled"=dword:00000000</li> <li>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Ciphers\RC4 40/128] "Enabled"=dword:00000000</li> <li>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Ciphers\RC4 56/128] "Enabled"=dword:00000000</li> </ul><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update.
