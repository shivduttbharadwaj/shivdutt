		<Title>MS04-028: Buffer Overrun in JPEG Processing (GDI+) Could Allow Code Execution - Visio 2003</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a security vulnerability in the processing of JPEG image formats that could allow remote code execution. The affected component, GDI+, is a graphics device interface that is used in nearly all .NET Framework applications. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch is included in Visio 2003 Service Pack 1.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Some Office updates will <b>force</b> the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update.<BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 1.02 MB<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This security update is also referenced under KB838345.
