		<Title>MS05-050: Vulnerability in DirectShow Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows XP SP1 (v2, re-released 12/13/2005) - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS05-050. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating security vulnerabilities in DirectShow. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in DirectShow that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this update will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.<BR><BR><b>Important Note:</b> This patch was re-released on December 13th, 2005 to address an installation issue in the original patch. The action below deploys the revised version of the patch. Microsoft recommends installing the revised patch only if the original is not already installed. This Fixlet message will become relevant only if neither the original nor the revised version of the patch is installed. See the FAQ section of the security bulletin for more information.
