		<Title>UPDATE: ISA Server 2000 Service Pack 2 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><FONT size=2>The listed computers have faulty installations of ISA Server 2000 Service Pack 2. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch, or essential files installed by the patch have been removed. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this program to ensure the safety of affected computers. <br><br>Microsoft has released Service Pack 2 for Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2000 (ISA Server 2000). The service pack includes the latest performance enhancing updates, as well as all previous hotfixes. Microsoft has released this update as an easier way to manage the rollout of security patches and other fixes. BigFix requires this update to establish a baseline for vulnerability analysis. <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This service pack cannot be applied on trial versions of ISA Server. <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update. <BR><BR><FONT color=#ff0000><B>Important Note:</B></FONT> Upon completion this patch may <STRONG>force</STRONG> the affected computer to restart. <BR><BR><FONT color=#ff0000><B>Important Note:</B></FONT> Microsoft recommends that affected computers be disconnected from the Internet&nbsp;during installation of ISA Server 2000 SP2. Applying the action below will <STRONG>not</STRONG> disconnect the computer from the Internet prior to&nbsp;service pack application.<BR><BR><B>File Size:</B> 3.80 MB</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
