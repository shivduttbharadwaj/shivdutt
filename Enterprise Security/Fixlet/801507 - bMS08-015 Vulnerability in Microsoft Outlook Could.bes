		<Title>MS08-015: Vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Outlook 2000 SP3 - Windows 9x/ME (Admin Installation)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Office Outlook. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if Outlook is passed a specially crafted mailto URI. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. This vulnerability is not exploitable by simply viewing an e-mail through the Outlook preview pane.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future update rollup.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled. </P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Some Office updates will <STRONG>force</STRONG> the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update. </P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> In preparation for deploying this update through an Administrative Installation Point, you must apply this patch to all Administrative Installation Points in your network. For instructions on how to install this patch to your Administrative Installation Point, see the 'Security Update' section of the security bulletin.</P> <P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Important Note:</STRONG></FONT> There are known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.</P><P><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB946986.</P><P><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for this Fixlet message due to known issues associated with the installation of this patch. Please review the Known Issues section of the security bulletin prior to deploying this patch.
