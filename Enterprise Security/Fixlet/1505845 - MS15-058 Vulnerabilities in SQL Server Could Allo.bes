		<Title>MS15-058: Vulnerabilities in SQL Server Could Allow Remote Code Execution - SQL Server 2014 - QFE Branch - KB3045323 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft SQL Server. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an authenticated attacker runs a specially crafted query that is designed to execute a virtual function from a wrong address, leading to a function call to uninitialized memory. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need permissions to create or modify a database.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3045323.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
