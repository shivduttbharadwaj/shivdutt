		<Title>MS13-015: Vulnerability in .NET Framework Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - .NET Framework 4 - Windows XP SP3 / Windows 7 Gold</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This patch has been partially superseded by MS15-048. Whereas this Fixlet previously applied to Windows XP SP3 / Windows Server 2003 SP2 / Windows Vista SP2 / Windows Server 2008 SP2 / Windows 7 Gold/SP1, it now only applies to Windows XP SP3 / Windows 7 Gold.</P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves one privately reported vulnerability in the .NET Framework. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if a user views a specially crafted webpage using a web browser that can run XAML Browser Applications (XBAPs). The vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2789642.<BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
