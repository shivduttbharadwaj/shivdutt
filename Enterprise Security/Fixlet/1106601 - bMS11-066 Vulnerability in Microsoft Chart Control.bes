		<Title>MS11-066: Vulnerability in Microsoft Chart Control Could Allow Information Disclosure - Microsoft .NET Framework 4 - Windows XP SP3 / 2003 SP2 / Vista SP2 / 2008 SP2 / 7 Gold/SP1</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in ASP.NET Chart controls. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if an attacker sent a specially crafted GET request to an affected server hosting the Chart controls. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate the attacker's user rights directly, but it could be used to retrieve information that could be used to further compromise the affected system. Only web applications using Microsoft Chart Control are affected by this issue. Default installations of the .NET Framework are not affected.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2487367.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
