		<Title>MS11-051: Vulnerability in Active Directory Certificate Services Web Enrollment Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - Windows Server 2008 Gold/SP2 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Active Directory Certificate Services Web Enrollment. The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could allow elevation of privilege, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the site in the context of the target user. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would need to send a specially crafted link and convince a user to click the link. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force a user to visit the Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade a user to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes the user to the vulnerable Web site.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
