<DIV class=FixletMessage>
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS06-056. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch that resolves a newly discovered, privately reported vulnerability in a server running a vulnerable version of the .Net Framework 2.0. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to information. Although this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code to elevate their user rights directly, it could be used to acquire information that could be used to further compromise the affected system. <BR><BR>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><b>Note</b>: Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><b>Note</b>: Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in a future Service Pack.<BR><BR><b>Important Note:</b> There are known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Caveats section of the security bulletin for more information.
