<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><FONT size=2>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS05-004. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<br><br>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a security vulnerability in ASP.NET that could allow an attacker to bypass the security of an ASP.NET Web site and gain unauthorized access. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability. <br><br><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch is included in Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.0 Service Pack 4. <br><br><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <br><br><b>Note:</b> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update.<br><br><b>Important Note:</b> After running this patch, a user logon may be required to complete patch installation.<br><br><b>Important Note:</b> There are known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Caveats section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><FONT color=red><STRONG>Important Note:</STRONG></FONT>&nbsp;Installation of this security update will cause subsequent deployments of .NET Framework 1.0 SP3 to fail. If you plan&nbsp;on&nbsp;upgrading to&nbsp;.NET&nbsp;Framework 1.0 SP3, deploy the service pack first before installing this patch.
