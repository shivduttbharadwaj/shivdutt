		<Title>MS04-012: Cumulative Update for Microsoft RPC/DCOM - Windows 2000</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
Microsoft has released a patch to resolve several newly-discovered vulnerabilities in RPC/DCOM.&nbsp; An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then take any action on the affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.&nbsp; After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in Windows 2000 Service Pack 5.<BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 4.45 MB
