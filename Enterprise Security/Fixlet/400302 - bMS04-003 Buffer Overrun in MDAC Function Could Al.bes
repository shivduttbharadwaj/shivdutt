		<Title>MS04-003: Buffer Overrun in MDAC Function Could Allow Code Execution - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><FONT Size=2>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS04-003. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<br><br>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a security vulnerability in the Microsoft Data Access Components functions. MDAC provides the underlying functionality for a number of database operations, such as connecting to remote databases and returning data to a client. When a client computer on a network tries to see a list of computers that are running Microsoft SQL Server and that are residing on the network, it sends a broadcast request to all the devices that are on the network. Because of a flaw in a specific MDAC component, an attacker can respond with a specially crafted packet that causes a buffer overflow to occur. An attacker who successfully exploited this flaw could gain the same level of privileges over the system as the application that initiated the broadcast request. The actions an attacker could carry out would be dependent on the permissions which the application using MDAC ran under. This patch also supersedes the patch published in MS03-033. After downloading and installing this patch, affected machines will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability. <br><br><b>Note:</b> Affected computers will report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but the vulnerability will not be closed until the affected computer is restarted. <br><br><b>Note:</b> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff0000><B>Important Note:</B></FONT> Microsoft has indicated that application of this update may lead to errors if the TEMP directory is encrypted.
