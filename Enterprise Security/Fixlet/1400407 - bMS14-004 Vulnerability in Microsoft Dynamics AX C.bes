		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Dynamics AX. The vulnerability could allow denial of service if an authenticated attacker submits specially crafted data to an affected Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS) instance. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the target AOS instance to stop responding to client requests.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR> <P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></STRONG> Due to the complexity of the installation, this update must be completed manually.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> There is no default action for this Fixlet message because it does not have a deployment action.
