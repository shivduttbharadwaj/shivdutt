		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS04-028. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a security vulnerability in the processing of JPEG image formats that could allow remote code execution. The affected component, GDI+, is a graphics device interface that is used in nearly all .NET Framework applications. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch is included in the .NET Framework 1.0 Service Pack 3. The service pack can be deployed through fixlet message #402819.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 1.09 MB
