		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS08-052. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<br /><br /> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows GDI+. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted image file using affected software or browsed a Web site that contains specially crafted content. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update will be included in a future service pack.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB947739.<br><br><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This update only applies for application developers who develop their software on systems running Windows 2000 SP 4.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
