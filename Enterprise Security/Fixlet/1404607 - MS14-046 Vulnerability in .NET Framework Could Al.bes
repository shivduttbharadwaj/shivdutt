		<Title>MS14-046: Vulnerability in .NET Framework Could Allow Security Feature Bypass - Windows Server 2012 R2 Gold / Windows 8.1 Gold - .NET Framework 3.5 - KB2966828 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The vulnerability could allow security feature bypass if a user visits a specially crafted website. In a web-browsing attack scenario, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the Knowledge Base Article for more information.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2966828.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
