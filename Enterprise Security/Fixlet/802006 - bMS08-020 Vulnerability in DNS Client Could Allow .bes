		<Title>MS08-020: Vulnerability in DNS Client Could Allow Spoofing - Windows XP Gold (x64) - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS11-030. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows XP Gold/SP2 (x64), it now only applies to Windows XP Gold (x64).</P> <P>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS08-020. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability. This spoofing vulnerability exists in Windows DNS clients and could allow an attacker to send specially crafted responses to DNS requests, thereby spoofing or redirecting Internet traffic from legitimate locations.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
