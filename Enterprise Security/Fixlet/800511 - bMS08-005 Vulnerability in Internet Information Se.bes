		<Title>MS08-005: Vulnerability in Internet Information Services Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - Windows Vista</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P>Microsoft has released an important update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Internet Information Services (IIS). A local attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><B></B></P> <P><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update&nbsp;will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
