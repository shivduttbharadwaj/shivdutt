		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS06-014. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.</P> <P>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a&nbsp;newly-discovered, privately-reported security vulnerability in the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) Function.&nbsp; If a user is logged on with administrative rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</P> <P>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Some progress windows may be visible briefly during installation of this patch.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. </P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
