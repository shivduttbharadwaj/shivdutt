		<Title>MS10-082: Vulnerability in Windows Media Player Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows Media Player 11 - Windows Server 2008 Gold</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This patch has been partially superseded by MS15-057. Whereas this Fixlet previously applied to Windows Server 2008 Gold/SP2, it now only applies to Windows Server 2008 Gold.</P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Windows Media Player. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if Windows Media Player opened specially crafted media content hosted on a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
