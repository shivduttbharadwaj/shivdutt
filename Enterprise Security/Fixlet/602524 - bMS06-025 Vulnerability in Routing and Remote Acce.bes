		<Title>MS06-025: Vulnerability in Routing and Remote Access Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows Server 2003 (v2, re-released 6/27/2006) - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS06-025. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating several newly discovered, privately reported security vulnerabilities in the Routing and Remote Access Service. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. <BR><BR>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in future Service Pack or Update Rollup. <BR><BR><b>Important Note:</b> There are several known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Caveats section of the security bulletin for more information. <BR><BR><b>Important Note:</b> This patch was re-released on June 27, 2006 to address an issue involving dial-up connections that use a post-connect terminal window or dial-up scripting. Microsoft recommends installing the revised patch only if you are affected by this issue or if the original patch is not installed. This Fixlet message will not become relevant if the original version of the patch is installed. The action below deploys the revised version of the patch.
