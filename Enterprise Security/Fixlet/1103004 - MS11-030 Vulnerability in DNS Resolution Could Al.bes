		<Title>MS11-030: Vulnerability in DNS Resolution Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows XP SP2 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Windows DNS resolution. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if an attacker gained access to the network and then created a custom program to send specially crafted LLMNR broadcast queries to the target systems. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the LLMNR ports should be blocked from the Internet.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2509553.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
