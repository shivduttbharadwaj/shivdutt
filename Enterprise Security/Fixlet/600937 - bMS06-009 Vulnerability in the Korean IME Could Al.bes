		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a privilege elevation vulnerability in the Korean IME Language Bar in Office 2003 MUI. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. For an attack to be successful, the attacker must be able to interactively logon to the affected system. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability. <br><br><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in a future service pack. <br><br><b>Important Note: </b>Due to the complexity of this update, installation of this security update must be completed manually or via the "Local" or "Network" Office deployment method. <br><br><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for this Fixlet message because it does not have a deployment action. For more information on default actions, see BigFix KB #474.<br><br><div class="HideFromWebUI"><b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.</div></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
