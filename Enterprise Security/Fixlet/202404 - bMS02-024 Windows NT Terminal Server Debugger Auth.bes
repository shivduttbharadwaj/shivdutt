		<Title>MS02-024: Windows NT Terminal Server Debugger Authentication Flaw - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS02-024. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>This patch eliminates a security vulnerability in the Windows NT debugger. Windows Debugging allows debuggers to take over running applications, which gives the debuggers the security privileges of the application. A flaw in the way Microsoft debugging facility handles authentication would allow an arbitrary application to be authenticated as a debugger and take over any running application. This allows for a substantial elevation of security privileges if non-privileged users are allowed to logon interactively. If an attacker took over an application running as the Operating System, it would have the ability to run arbitrary code on the client computer. This patch corrects the authentication flaw. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update. <BR><BR><b>Note: </b>Once this Fixlet has completed its action, affected computers will report back 'Pending Restart', as the vulnerability will not yet be closed. Once the computer has been restarted, it will report its final status. <BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 93 KB
