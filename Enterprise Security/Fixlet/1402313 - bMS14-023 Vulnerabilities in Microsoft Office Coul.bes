		<Title>MS14-023: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Office 2010 SP1 - KB2878284 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS15-012. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Office 2010 SP1 / SP2 (x64), it now only applies to Office 2010 SP1 (x64).</P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens an Office file that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted library file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2878284.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
