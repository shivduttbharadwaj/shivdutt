		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS05-051. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating security vulnerabilities in MSDTC and COM+. An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that the update for this issue will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update.<BR><BR><b>Important Note:</b> There are known issues associated with the installation of this patch. In particular, systems with non-default ACL settings may experience unexpected behavior. Please see the "Caveats" section of the security bulletin for more information.
