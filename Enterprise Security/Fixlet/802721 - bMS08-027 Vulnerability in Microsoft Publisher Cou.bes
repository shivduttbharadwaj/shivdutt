		<Title>MS08-027: Vulnerability in Microsoft Publisher Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Office 2007 (Superseded)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>This update has been superseded because Microsoft has stopped offering the deployed binary.<br /><br /><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS09-030. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Microsoft Publisher Gold/SP1, it now only applies to Microsoft Publisher Gold.</P> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Publisher that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Publisher file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future&nbsp;update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.</P> <P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></STRONG> There are known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB950114.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
