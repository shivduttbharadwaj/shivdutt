		<Title>MS06-041: Vulnerability in DNS Resolution Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows XP/2003 (x64) - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS06-041. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released an update that resolves two privately-reported vulnerabilities in Winsock and DNS Client that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities to take complete control of the affected system. For an attack on Winsock to be successful the attacker would have to force the user to open a file or visit a website that is specially crafted to call the affected Winsock API.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.
