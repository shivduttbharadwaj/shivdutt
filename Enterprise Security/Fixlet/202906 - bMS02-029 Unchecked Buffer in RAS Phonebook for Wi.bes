		<Title>MS02-029: Unchecked Buffer in RAS Phonebook for Windows 2000 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS02-029. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>This patch addresses a vulnerability in Remote Access Service (RAS). RAS is a service which allows computers and networks to connect over a phone line. The RAS phonebook implementation contains a flaw and is susceptible to a buffer overrun. This buffer overrun could result in either system failure or code being run with LocalSystem privileges. After downloading and installing this patch, the affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability. <BR><BR><b>Note: </b>Once this Fixlet has completed its action, affected computers will report back 'Pending Restart', as the vulnerability will not yet be closed. Once the computer has been restarted, it will report its final status. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This patch is included in Windows 2000 Service Pack 3.<BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 0.99 MB
