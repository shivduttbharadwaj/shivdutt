		<Title>MS03-012: Flaw In Winsock Proxy Service - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS03-012. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a security vulnerability in Proxy Server 2.0. There is a flaw in the Winsock Proxy service in Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0, and the Microsoft Firewall service in ISA Server 2000, that would allow an attacker on the internal network to send a specially crafted packet that would cause the server to stop responding to internal and external requests. Receipt of such a packet would cause CPU utilization on the server to reach 100%, and thus make the server unresponsive. After applying this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability. <BR><BR><b>Note</b>: Once this Fixlet has completed its action, affected computers will report back 'Pending Restart', as the vulnerability will not yet be closed. Once the computer has been restarted, it will report its final status. <BR><b><BR>Note</b>: Client machines will automatically open the text file "hotfix.txt" included in the patch and may briefly display progress and command prompt windows during installation of this update. <BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 408 KB
