		<Title>MS03-002: Cumulative Patch for Microsoft Content Management Server - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS03-002. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>This security rollup package eliminates a new vulnerability in Microsoft Content Management Server 2001 (MCMS), including all old vulnerabilities for MCMS. The new vulnerability allows a malicious user to use a script on the victim's computer by embedding the script into a link to a site generated by MCMS. When the page is generated by MCMS, the script will be incorporated into the page. This could result in an attacker being able to access information the user shared with the legitimate site. After downloading and installing the security rollup package, affected machines will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This patch requires a local administrator present at the client computer to complete the installation manually.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in Content Management Server 2001 Service Pack 2. <BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 1.43 MB
