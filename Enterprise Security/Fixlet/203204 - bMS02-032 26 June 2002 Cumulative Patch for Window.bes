We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>This cumulative patch eliminates all previously addressed security vulnerabilities affecting Windows Media Player 7.1. This patch also eliminates three new security vulnerabilities, the most serious of which could be used to run code of an attacker's choice.
