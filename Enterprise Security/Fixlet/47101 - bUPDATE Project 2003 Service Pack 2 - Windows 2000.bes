		<Title>UPDATE: Project 2003 Service Pack 2 - Windows 2000/XP/2003 (Network/Local Installation)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
Microsoft has released Project 2003 Service Pack 2. This update contains significant security enhancements, in addition to stability and performance improvements. This service pack includes updates previously released for Project 2003. Project 2003 SP2 will install even if a publicly available update or service pack has already been installed on the affected computer. <BR><b><BR>Note:</b> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update.<BR><b><BR>Note:</b> Some Office updates will <b>force</b> the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> If Windows Installer version 3.0 is installed you will need to upgrade to Windows Installer version 3.1. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> The "Local Installation" action requires a local user to insert the correct Project 2003 CD in a local CD-ROM drive.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> The "Network Installation" action will disable the Local Installation Source if it exists and points the installer to the specified network share.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> There is no default action for this Fixlet message because it has multiple actions, none of which is clearly recommended over the others. For more information on default actions, see BigFix KB #474.
