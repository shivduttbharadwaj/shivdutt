		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This patch has been partially superseded by MS16-058. Whereas this Fixlet previously applied to Windows Server 2008 Gold/SP2, it now only applies to Windows Server 2008 Gold.</P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Internet Information Services (IIS). The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user received a specially crafted HTTP request. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></STRONG> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Systems running supported editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 that do not have KB973917 installed are not vulnerable to MS10-040.<BR><BR><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Microsoft has announced that this update will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
