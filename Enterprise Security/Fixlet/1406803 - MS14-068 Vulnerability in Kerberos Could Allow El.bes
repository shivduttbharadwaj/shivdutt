		<Title>MS14-068: Vulnerability in Kerberos Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - Windows 7 SP1 - KB3011780</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Kerberos KDC that could allow an attacker to elevate unprivileged domain user account privileges to those of the domain administrator account. An attacker could use these elevated privileges to compromise any computer in the domain, including domain controllers. An attacker must have valid domain credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The affected component is available remotely to users who have standard user accounts with domain credentials; this is not the case for users with local account credentials only. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft was aware of limited, targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3011780.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
