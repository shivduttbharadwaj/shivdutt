		<Title>MS07-048: Vulnerabilities in Windows Gadgets Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows Vista (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a patch that resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in addition to other vulnerabilities identified during the course of the investigation. These vulnerabilities could allow an anonymous remote attacker to run code with the privileges of the logged on user. If a user subscribed to a malicious RSS feed in the Feed Headlines Gadget or added a malicious contacts file in the Contacts Gadget or a user clicked on a malicious link in the Weather Gadget an attacker could potentially run code on the system. In all attack vectors, users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. <P>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in a future update rollup.</P> <P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are several known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Caveats section of the security bulletin for more information.</P><P><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for this Fixlet message due to known issues associated with the installation of this patch.
