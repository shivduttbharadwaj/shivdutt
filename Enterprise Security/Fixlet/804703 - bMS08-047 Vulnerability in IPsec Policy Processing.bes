		<Title>MS08-047: Vulnerability in IPsec Policy Processing Could Allow Information Disclosure - Windows Vista Gold/SP1 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released an update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the way certain Windows Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) rules are applied. This vulnerability could cause systems to ignore IPsec policies and transmit network traffic in clear text. This, in turn, would disclose information intended to be encrypted on the network. An attacker viewing the traffic on the network would be able to view and possibly modify the contents of the traffic. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly. It could be used to collect useful information to try to further compromise the affected system or network.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Microsoft has announced that this will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
