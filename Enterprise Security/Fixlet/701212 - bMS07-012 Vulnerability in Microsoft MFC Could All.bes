<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS07-012. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<br><br>Microsoft has released an update that resolves a newly discovered, privately reported vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch may be included in future Service Pack or Update Rollup.<br><br><b>Note:</b> The "Local Installation" action requires a local user to insert the correct Visual Studio .NET 2003 CD in a local CD-ROM drive only if the Visual Studio .NET 2003 installation files are not already cached locally. <br><br><b>Note:</b> The "Network Installation" action will disable the Local Installation Source if it exists and points the installer to the specified network share.<br><br><b><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></b> There are known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Caveats section of the security bulletin for more information. <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB924643.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
