<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS11-052. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows 2003 SP1/SP2, it now only applies to Windows 2003 SP1.</P> <P>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS07-050. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the Vector Markup Language (VML) implementation in Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. </P> <P>The security update addresses the vulnerability by strengthening the validation of requests to render VML within Internet Explorer. <BR></P> <P>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this patch&nbsp;will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P> <P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Important Note:</STRONG><FONT color=#000000> There are several known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the&nbsp;<SPAN class=193450823-12062007>Known Issues </SPAN>section of the security bulletin for more information.</FONT></FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
