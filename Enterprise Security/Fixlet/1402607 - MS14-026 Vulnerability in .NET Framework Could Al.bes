		<Title>MS14-026: Vulnerability in .NET Framework Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - Windows 7 SP1 - .NET Framework 3.5.1 - KB2931356</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if an unauthenticated attacker sends specially crafted data to an affected workstation or server that uses .NET Remoting. .NET Remoting is not widely used by applications; only custom applications that have been specifically designed to use .NET Remoting would expose a system to the vulnerability.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2931356.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
