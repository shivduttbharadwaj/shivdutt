		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS14-078. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<br><br>This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Input Method Editor (IME) (Japanese). The vulnerability could allow sandbox escape based on the application sandbox policy on a system where an affected version of the Microsoft IME (Japanese) is installed. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could escape the sandbox of a vulnerable application and gain access to the affected system with logged-in user rights. If the affected system is logged in with administrative rights, an attacker could then install programs; view, change or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2991963.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
