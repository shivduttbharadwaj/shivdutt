		<Title>MS08-015: Vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Outlook 2003 SP2 (Administrative Installation)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS09-060. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to&nbsp;Outlook 2003&nbsp;SP2/SP3 , it now only applies to Outlook 2003 SP2.</P> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Office Outlook. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if Outlook is passed a specially crafted mailto URI. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. This vulnerability is not exploitable by simply viewing an e-mail through the Outlook preview pane.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Some Office updates will <B>force</B> the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update. </P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> In preparation for deploying this update through an Administrative Installation Point, you must apply this patch to all Administrative Installation Points in your network. For instructions on how to install this patch to your Administrative Installation Point, see the 'Security Update' section of the security bulletin.</P> <P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Important Note:</STRONG></FONT> There are known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB945432.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for the Fixlet message because it requires additional preparation before deployment.
