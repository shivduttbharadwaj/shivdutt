		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS04-026. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty.&nbsp; As a result, the listed computers may contain the vulnerability discussed in MS04-026.<BR><BR>Unfortunately, the update package provided by Microsoft cannot run if the update has been applied but the file versions do not correspond to those installed by the update.&nbsp; Similarly, the update package provided by Microsoft cannot be uninstalled if the file versions do not correspond to those installed by the update. As a result, we recommend users contact Microsoft directly for help installing this patch on computers with outdated file versions.
