		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS09-061. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows&nbsp;2003&nbsp;SP1/SP2 x64&nbsp;and Windows XP SP1/SP2 x64, it now only applies to Windows&nbsp;2003 SP1 x64 and Windows XP SP1 x64.</P> <P>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS07-040. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch that resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities. Two of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution on client systems with .NET Framework installed, and one could allow information disclosure on Web servers running ASP.NET. In all remote code execution cases, users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that the update for this issue may be included in a future update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><B>Important Note:</B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.</P> <P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Important Note:</STRONG></FONT><FONT color=#000000> BigFix has received reports of various issues associated with the deployment of this patch. Please take extra caution to qualify this update in a test environment prior to use in a production environment.</FONT></P> <P><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB928366.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
