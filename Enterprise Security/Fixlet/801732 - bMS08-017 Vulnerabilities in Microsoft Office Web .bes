		<Title>MS08-017: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Web Components Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Visual Studio .NET 2003 SP1 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS08-017. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR> <P>Microsoft has released a critical update that resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Web Components. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Web page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.</P> <P><STRONG>Note: </STRONG>Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future update rollup.</P> <P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Important Note:</STRONG></FONT> There are known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.</P><P><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB933369.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
