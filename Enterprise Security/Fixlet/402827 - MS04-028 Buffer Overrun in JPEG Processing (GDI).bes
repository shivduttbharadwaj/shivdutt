		<Title>MS04-028: Buffer Overrun in JPEG Processing (GDI+) Could Allow Code Execution - Office 2003 (Administrative Installation)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a security vulnerability in the processing of JPEG image formats that could allow remote code execution. The affected component, GDI+, is a graphics device interface that is used in nearly all .NET Framework applications. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability. <br><br><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that patch is included in the Office 2003 Service Pack 1. <br><br><b>Note: </b>Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update. <br><br><b>Note: </b>If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.<br><br><b>Note: </b>In preparation for deploying this update through an Administrative Installation Point, you must apply this patch to all Administrative Installation Points in your network. For instructions on how to install this patch to your Administrative Installation Point, see the 'Security Update' section of the security bulletin.<br><br><b>Note: </b>Some Office updates will <b>force</b> the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update. <br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB838905.<br><br><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for the Fixlet message because it requires additional preparation before deployment. For more information on default actions, see BigFix KB #474.<br><br><div class="HideFromWebUI"><b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.</div></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
