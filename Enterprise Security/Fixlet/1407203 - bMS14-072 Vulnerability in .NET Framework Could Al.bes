		<Title>MS14-072: Vulnerability in .NET Framework Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - Windows Vista SP2 - .NET Framework 4.5/4.5.1/4.5.2 - KB2978128 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This patch has been partially superseded by KB4041093 and KB4041090. Whereas this Fixlet previously applied to Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 / Windows 7 SP1 / Windows Server 2008 SP2 / Windows Vista SP2, it now only applies to Windows Vista SP2.</P>This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker sends specially crafted data to an affected workstation or server that uses.NET Remoting. Only custom applications that have been specifically designed to use .NET Remoting would expose a system to the vulnerability.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2978128.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
