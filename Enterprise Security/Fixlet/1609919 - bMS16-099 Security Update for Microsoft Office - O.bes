<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves vulnerabilities in MicrosoftOffice. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote codeexecution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. Anattacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could runarbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whoseaccounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could beless impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3114885.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
