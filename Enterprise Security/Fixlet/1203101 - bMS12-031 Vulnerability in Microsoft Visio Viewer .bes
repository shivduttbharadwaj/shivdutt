<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><STRONG> <P>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS12-059. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Office 2010 Gold/SP1, it now only applies to Office 2010 Gold.</P> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Visio file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2597981.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
