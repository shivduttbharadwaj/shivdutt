		<Title>MS08-076: Vulnerabilities in Windows Media Components Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5 - Windows Server 2003 SP1/SP2 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS08-076. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<br /><br />Microsoft has released a security update that resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in the following Windows Media components: Windows Media Player, Windows Media Format Runtime, and Windows Media Services. The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB952069.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
