		<Title>MS04-011: Security Update for Microsoft Windows - Windows Server 2003 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><FONT size=2>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS04-011. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating several newly-discovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff0000><B>Important Note:</B></FONT> Microsoft has indicated that computers may not be able to open EMF image files created in Adobe Illustrator after application of this update.
