<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><p><B>Prerequsite: </B>KB4039648 needs to be installed prior to applying this update. </p><p> A remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET software when the software fails to check the source markup of a file. An Authentication Bypass vulnerability exists in WCF and WIF, allowing signing of SAML tokens with arbitrary symmetric keys. This vulnerability allows an attacker to impersonate another user. The vulnerability exists in WCF, WIF 3.5 and above in .NET Framework, WIF 1.0 component in Windows, WIF Nuget package, and WIF implementation in Sharepoint. An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Exchange and Azure Active Directory allow creation of entities with Display Names having non-printable characters. <br><br> To learn more about the vulnerabilities, go to the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). </p><ul class="sbody-free_list"> <li> <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1113" id="kb-link-2" target="_self">CVE-2019-1113</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1006" id="kb-link-2" target="_self">CVE-2019-1006</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1083" id="kb-link-2" target="_self">CVE-2019-1083</a> </li> </ul><p> <strong> <span class="text-base">Important</span> </strong> </p><ul> <li> All updates for .NET Framework 4.6 for Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2 (SP2) require that the d3dcompiler_47.dll update is installed.
