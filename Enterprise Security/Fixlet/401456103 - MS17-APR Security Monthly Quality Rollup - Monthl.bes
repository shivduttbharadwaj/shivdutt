<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This patch has been partially superseded by KB4019115. Whereas this Fixlet previously applied to Windows Server 2008 SP2 / Windows Vista SP2, it now only applies to Windows Vista SP2.</P><div class="kb-summary-section section">This update resolves a vulnerability in the Microsoft .NET Framework that could allow remote code execution when the .NET Framework fails to properly validate input before loading libraries. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could take control of an affected system.&nbsp;The attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. To learn more about this vulnerability, see <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0160" id="kb-link-2" target="_self">Microsoft Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE17-0160</a>.</div><br><p><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</p><p><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.</p><p><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB4014984.</p></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
