		<Title>MS15-057: Vulnerability in Windows Media Player Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows Vista SP2 - Windows Media Player 11 - KB3033890 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if Windows Media Player opens specially crafted media content that is hosted on a malicious website. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3033890.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
