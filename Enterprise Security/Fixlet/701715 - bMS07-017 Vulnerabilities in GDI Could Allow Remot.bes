Customers who have already successfully applied this update need not take any action.</P> <P>Microsoft has released a patch&nbsp;resolving several newly discovered, publicly disclosed and privately reported&nbsp;vulnerabilities as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these&nbsp;vulnerabilities could take complete control of the affected workstation. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. </P> <P>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this patch&nbsp;will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.</P> <P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are several known issues associated with the installation of this patch.
