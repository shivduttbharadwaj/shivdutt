<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, Skype for Business, Silverlight and Microsoft Lync. The most serious of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user either visits a specially crafted website or opens a specially crafted document. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<p><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</p><p><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.</p><p><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3189040.</p></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
