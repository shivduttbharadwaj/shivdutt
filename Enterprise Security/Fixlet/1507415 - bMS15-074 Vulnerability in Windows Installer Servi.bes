		<Title>MS15-074: Vulnerability in Windows Installer Service Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - Windows Vista SP2 - KB3072630 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if the Windows Installer service improperly runs custom action scripts. An attacker must first compromise a user who is logged on to the target system to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3072630.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
