		<Title>MS13-105: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 3 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves three publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server. The most severe of these vulnerabilities exist in the WebReady Document Viewing and Data Loss Prevention features of Microsoft Exchange Server. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution in the security context of the LocalService account if an attacker sends an email message containing a specially crafted file to a user on an affected Exchange server. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local system and presents anonymous credentials on the network<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2880833.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
