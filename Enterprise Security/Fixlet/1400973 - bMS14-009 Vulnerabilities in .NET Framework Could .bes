		<Title>MS14-009: Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - .NET Framework 4.5.1 - KB2898870 - Windows 8 Gold</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The most severe vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if a user visits a specially crafted website or a website containing specially crafted web content. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit such websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the compromised website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the Knowledge Base Article for more information.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2898870.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
