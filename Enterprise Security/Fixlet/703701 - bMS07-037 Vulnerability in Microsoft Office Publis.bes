		<Title>MS07-037: Vulnerability in Microsoft Office Publisher 2007 Could Allow Remote Code Execution (Superseded)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
This update has been superseded because Microsoft has stopped offering the deployed binary.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a security patch for Publisher 2007. This update resolves one publicly reported vulnerability. This vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Microsoft Office Publisher file. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch may be included in a future service pack. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This security update is also referenced under KB936646.
