		<Title>MS02-070: Flaw in SMB Signing Could Enable Group Policy to be Modified - Windows XP - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS02-070. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>The SMB (Server Message Block) protocol is used both as a file-sharing protocol and as a means of disseminating group policy information from domain controllers to newly logged on users. Packets on an SMB session can be signed to improve the integrity of the session. <BR><BR>A flaw exists in the Windows XP implementation of the SMB protocol that would allow a malicious user to downgrade the signing settings of an SMB session, thereby allowing unsigned data to be sent between a client and server. <BR><BR>Any machine that communicates with a machine that requires SMB signing is exposed to this vulnerability. Microsoft rates this vulnerability as being a moderate security risk. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Once this Fixlet has completed its action, affected computers will report back 'Pending Restart', as the vulnerability will not yet be closed. Once the computer has been restarted, it will report its final status.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in Windows XP Service Pack 2. <BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 571 KB
