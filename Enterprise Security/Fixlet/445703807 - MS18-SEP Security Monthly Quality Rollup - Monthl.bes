<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This update has been superseded by KB4483455.<br /><br /><div class="kb-summary-section section"><br><p>This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework that could allow remote code execution when .NET Framework processes untrusted input. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability in software by using .NET Framework could take control of an affected system. The attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts that have full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p><br><br><p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to convince the user to open a malicious document or application.</p><br><br><p>This security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Framework validates untrusted input.</p><br>To learn more about this vulnerability, see <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8421" id="kb-link-2" managed-link="" target="_blank">Microsoft Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE-2018-8421</a>.</div><br><p><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</p><p><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.</p><p><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB4457918.</p></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
