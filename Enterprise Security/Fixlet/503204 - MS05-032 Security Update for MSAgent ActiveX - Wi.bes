		<Title>MS05-032: Security Update for MSAgent ActiveX - Windows Server 2003 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS05-032. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating security vulnerabilities in MSAgent ActiveX. This is a spoofing vulnerability that could enable an attacker to spoof trusted Internet content. Users could believe that they are accessing trusted Internet content. However, they are accessing malicious Internet content such as a malicious Web site. An attacker would first have to persuade a user to visit the attacker's site to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><b>Note</b>: Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><b>Note</b>: Microsoft has announced that the update for this issue will be included in Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2.
