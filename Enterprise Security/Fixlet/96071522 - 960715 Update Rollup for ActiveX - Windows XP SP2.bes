		<Title>960715: Update Rollup for ActiveX - Windows XP SP2/SP3 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in 960715. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<br /><br /> <P>Microsoft is releasing a new set of ActiveX kill bits with this advisory. This update includes kill bits for&nbsp;previously published Microsoft security bulletin MS08-070. The update also includes kill bits for Akamai Download Manager and Research In Motion (RIM) AxLoader.&nbsp;These kill bits&nbsp;prevent Internet Explorer from loading a number of ActiveX controls identified as security vulnerabilities by Akamai Technologies and Research In Motion (RIM). </P> <P>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
