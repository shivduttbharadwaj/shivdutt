		<Title>MS02-048: Flaw in Certificate Enrollment Control Could Allow Deletion of Digital Certificates - Windows NT TSE - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS02-048. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>This patch eliminates a security vulnerability resulting from a flaw in Certificate Enrollment Control, an ActiveX control responsible for enrolling web-based certificates. A malicious user can launch a denial of service attack by deleting or corrupting digital certificates on a user's system. This patch eliminates the vulnerability by upgrading the Certificate Enrollment Control. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Once this Fixlet has completed its action, affected computers will report back 'Pending Restart', as the vulnerability will not yet be closed. Once the computer has been restarted, it will report its final status. <BR><BR><b>Note: </b>Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update. <BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 268 KB
