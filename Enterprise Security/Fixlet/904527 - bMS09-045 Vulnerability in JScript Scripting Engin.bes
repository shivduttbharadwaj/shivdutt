		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS11-031. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows Vista Gold/SP1/SP2, it now only applies to Windows Vista Gold.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the JScript scripting engine that could allow remote code execution if a user opened a specially crafted file or visited a specially crafted Web site and invoked a malformed script. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update&nbsp;will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
