		<Title>MS07-017: Vulnerabilities in GDI Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows Vista (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a patch&nbsp;resolving several newly discovered, publicly disclosed and privately reported&nbsp;vulnerabilities as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these&nbsp;vulnerabilities could take complete control of the affected workstation. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. <P>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled. </P> <P><B>Note:</B> Affected computers will report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this patch&nbsp;will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.</P> <P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are several known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Caveats section of the security bulletin for more information.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
