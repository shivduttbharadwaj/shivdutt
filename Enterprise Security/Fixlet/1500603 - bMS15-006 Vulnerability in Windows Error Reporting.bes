		<Title>MS15-006: Vulnerability in Windows Error Reporting Could Allow Security Feature Bypass - Windows Server 2012 R2 Gold - KB3004365 (x64) (V2.0)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Windows Error Reporting (WER). The vulnerability could allow security feature bypass if successfully exploited by an attacker. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to the memory of a running process. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3004365.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
