		<Title>MS02-028: Heap Overrun in HTR chunked encoding - IIS 4.0 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS02-028. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a security vulnerability in IIS 5.0. A heap overrun vulnerability in the implementation of HTR scripting technology could allow an attacker to cause the server to fail. In some cases the attacker may be able to run arbitrary code on the server. HTR is an outdated scripting technology that is rarely used today. Installing this patch will eliminate the vulnerability. <BR><BR><b>Note: </b>Once this Fixlet has completed its action, affected computers will report back 'Pending Restart', as the vulnerability will not yet be closed. Once the computer has been restarted, it will report its final status. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update. <BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 87 KB
