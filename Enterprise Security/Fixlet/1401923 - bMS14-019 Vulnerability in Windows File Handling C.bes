		<Title>MS14-019: Vulnerability in Windows File Handling Component Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows 8 Gold</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user runs specially crafted .bat and .cmd files from a trusted or semi-trusted network location. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the network location or run the specially crafted files. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take such action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the location of the attacker's specially crafted files and subsequently convince them to run them.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the Knowledge Base Article for more information.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2922229.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
