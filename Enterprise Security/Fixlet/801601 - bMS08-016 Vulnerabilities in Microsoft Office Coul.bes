		<Title>MS08-016: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Office 2000 SP3 (Local Installation)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a malformed Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Some Office updates will <B>force</B> the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled. <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future update rollup.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Installation of this patch may require that the original Office 2000 CD be supplied on the local drive.</P><P><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB947361.</P><P><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for the Fixlet message because it requires additional preparation before deployment.
