		<Title>MS07-061: Vulnerability in Windows URI Handling Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows XP Gold (x64) - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS10-046. Whereas it used to apply to Windows XP Gold/SP2 (x64), it now only applies to Windows XP Gold (x64).</P> <P>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS07-061. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released an update that resolves a publicly reported vulnerability. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows shell handles specially crafted URIs that are passed to it. If the Windows shell did not sufficiently validate these URIs, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary code. Microsoft has only identified ways to exploit this vulnerability on systems using Internet Explorer 7. However, the vulnerability exists in a Windows file, Shell32.dll, which is included in all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update&nbsp;will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P> <P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Important Note:</STRONG></FONT> There are known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
