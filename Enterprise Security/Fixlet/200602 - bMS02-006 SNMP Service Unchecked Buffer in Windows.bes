		<Title>MS02-006: SNMP Service Unchecked Buffer in Windows 2000 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS02-006. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>This patch fixes an unchecked buffer vulnerability in the Microsoft Simple Network Management Protocol for Windows 2000. According to Microsoft, a buffer overrun is present in virtually all implementations of this service which can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service. In addition, it is possible that the attacker could cause code to run on the system in LocalSystem context, potentially providing the ability to take any desired action on the system. After installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><b>Note: </b>Once this Fixlet has completed its action, affected computers will report back 'Pending Restart', as the vulnerability will not yet be closed. Once the computer has been restarted, it will report its final status.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This patch is included in Windows 2000 Service Pack 3.<BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 510 KB
