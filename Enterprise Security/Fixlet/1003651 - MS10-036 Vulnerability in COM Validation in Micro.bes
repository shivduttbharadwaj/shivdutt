<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>This update has been superseded because Microsoft has stopped offering the deployed binary.<br /><br /><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS11-008. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Visio 2007 SP1/SP2, it now only applies to Visio 2007 SP1. </P> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in COM validation in Microsoft Office. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel, Word, Visio, Publisher, or PowerPoint file with an affected version of Microsoft Office. The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</P> <P>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</P> <P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.</P> <P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> In addition to this update, customers also need to install the update for 2007 Microsoft Office System Service Pack 1 and 2007 Microsoft Office System Service Pack 2 (KB982312) to be protected from the vulnerability described in this bulletin.<BR><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000><BR>Important Note:</FONT></STRONG> BigFix has received reports of various issues with the deployment of this patch on systems with Office Compatibility Pack 2007 SP1 and below installed.
