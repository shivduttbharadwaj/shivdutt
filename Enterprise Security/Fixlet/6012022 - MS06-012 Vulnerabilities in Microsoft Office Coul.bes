		<Title>MS06-012: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Office 2000 MUI - Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 (Administrative Installation)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security patch for Office 2000. This update resolves several newly-discovered, privately reported and public vulnerabilities. On vulnerable versions of Office, if a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client workstation.<br><br>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <br><br><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><b>Note:</b> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Some Office updates will <b>force</b> the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update. <br><br><b>Note:</b> In preparation for deploying this update through an Administrative Installation Point, you must apply this patch to all Administrative Installation Points in your network. For instructions on how to install this patch to your Administrative Installation Point, see the 'Security Update' section of the security bulletin.<br><br><b>Note:</b> You must upgrade all Office 2000 MultiLanguage Packs to Service Pack 3 before installing this patch.<br><br><b>Note:</b> This action attempts to update all Office 2000 SR1 MultiLanguage Pack Discs that are installed on targeted computers. <br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB905646.<br><br><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for the Fixlet message because it requires additional preparation before deployment. For more information on default actions, see BigFix KB #474.<br><br><div class="HideFromWebUI"><b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.</div></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
