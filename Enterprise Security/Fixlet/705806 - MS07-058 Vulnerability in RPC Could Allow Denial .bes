		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS09-026. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows&nbsp;XP Gold/SP1 x64, it now only applies to&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;XP&nbsp;Gold x64.</P> <P>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS07-058. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released an update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability. A denial of service vulnerability exists in the remote procedure call (RPC) facility due to a failure in communicating with the NTLM security provider when performing authentication of RPC requests. The vulnerability is documented in its own subsection in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
