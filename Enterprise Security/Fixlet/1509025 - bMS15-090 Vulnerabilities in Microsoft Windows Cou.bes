		<Title>MS15-090: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - Windows Server 2008 SP2 - KB3060716</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application or convinces a user to open a specially crafted file that invokes a vulnerable sandboxed application, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3060716.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
