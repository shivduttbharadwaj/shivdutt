		<Title>MS04-014: Vulnerability in the Microsoft Jet Database Engine Could Allow Code Execution - Windows NT</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
Microsoft has released a patch to resolve a buffer overrun vulnerability that exists in the Microsoft Jet Database Engine which could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update.<BR> <BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 3.69 MB
