		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). The vulnerability could reveal information pertaining to the service account used by AD FS. An attacker could then attempt logons from outside the corporate network, which would result in account lockout of the service account used by AD FS if an account lockout policy has been configured. This would result in denial of service for all applications relying on the AD FS instance.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2868846.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
