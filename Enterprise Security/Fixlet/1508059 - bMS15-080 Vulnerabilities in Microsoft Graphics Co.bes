		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Microsoft .NET Framework, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Lync, and Microsoft Silverlight. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted document or visits an untrusted webpage that contains embedded TrueType or OpenType fonts.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3072305.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
