		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the Windows Bluetooth Stack. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if an attacker sent a series of specially crafted Bluetooth packets to an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. This vulnerability only affects systems with Bluetooth capability.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2561109.<BR><BR> <P><FONT color=red><B>Important Note:</B></FONT> Windows Vista Feature Pack for Wireless (KB942567) must be installed before this Fixlet will become relevant.</P><P><FONT color=red><B>Important Note:</B></FONT> Microsoft will offer this update via Windows Update regardless of whether or not vulnerable files exist on the system as long as you previously have not installed this update. BigFix will only offer this update only if it detects vulnerable files exist on the system.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
