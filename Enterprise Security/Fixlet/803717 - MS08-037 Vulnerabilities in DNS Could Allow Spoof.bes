<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS11-030. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows Server 2003 SP1/SP2, it now only applies to Windows Server 2003 SP1.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in the Windows Domain Name System (DNS) that could allow spoofing. These vulnerabilities exist in both the DNS client and DNS server and could allow a remote attacker to redirect network traffic intended for systems on the Internet to the attacker's own systems.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update&nbsp;will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB951748.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
