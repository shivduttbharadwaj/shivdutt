		<Title>MS07-042: Vulnerability in Microsoft XML Core Services Could Allow Remote Code Execution - XML Core Services 5.0 - Office 2003 (Administrative Installation)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a patch that resolves a privately reported vulnerability. This vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could be exploited through attacks on Microsoft XML Core Services. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. <br><br>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><b>Note:</b> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Some Office updates will <b>force</b> the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update. <br><br><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><b>Note:</b> In preparation for deploying this update through an Administrative Installation Point, you must apply this patch to all Administrative Installation Points in your network. For instructions on how to install this patch to your Administrative Installation Point, see the 'Security Update' section of the security bulletin.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB936048.<br><br><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for the Fixlet message because it requires additional preparation before deployment. For more information on default actions, see BigFix KB #474.<br><br><div class="HideFromWebUI"><b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.</div></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
