<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><FONT size=2> <P>Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 (SP2) contains significant security enhancements, stability improvements, and performance improvements. Some of the fixes that are included with Office 2003 SP2 were previously released in separate updates. Office 2003 SP2 combines the previously released fixes into one update.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Some Office updates will force the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update.<BR><BR><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The "Local Installation" action requires a local user to insert the correct Office 2003 CD in a local CD-ROM drive <B>only</B> if the Office 2003 installation files are not already cached locally.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If Windows Installer version 3.0 is installed you will need to upgrade to Windows Installer version 3.1.</P></FONT><P><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for the Fixlet message because it requires additional preparation before deployment.
