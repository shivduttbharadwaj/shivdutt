		<Title>MS08-057: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Excel Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Office 2003 SP2 (Local/Network Installation)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Excel that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB955466.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Some Office updates will force the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.<BR><BR><SPAN id=dashboardLink></SPAN><SCRIPT type=text/javascript>var isEvansOrLater = '<?relevance if (exists property "datastore inspectors") then (True) else (False)?>' == 'True'?true:false;  document.body.onload = SetOfficeOverviewLink; function SetOfficeOverviewLink() { try {if (isEvansOrLater) { dashboardLink.innerHTML = Relevance('(format "<?rxlat <b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the {0}.?>" +  link "<?rxlat Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard?>" of bes wizard whose (dashboard id of it = "office_overview.ojo" AND id of site of it = 2) as string ) as string');} else { dashboardLink.innerHTML = EvaluateRelevance('"<b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the " & link "Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard" of bes wizard whose (dashboard id of it = "office_overview.ojo" AND id of site of it = 2) as string & "."');} } catch (e) {if (isEvansOrLater) { dashboardLink.innerHTML ='<?jxlat <b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.?>';} else { dashboardLink.innerHTML = '<b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.';} } } </SCRIPT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
