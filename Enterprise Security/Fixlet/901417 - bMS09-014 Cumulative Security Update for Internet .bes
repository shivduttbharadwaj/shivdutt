		<Title>MS09-014: Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer - IE 7 - Windows Server 2003 SP1</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS09-019. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows Server 2003 SP1/SP2, it now only applies to Windows Server 2003 SP1.</P> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities and two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer or if a user connects to an attacker's server by way of the HTTP protocol. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
