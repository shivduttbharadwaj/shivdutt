		<Title>MS10-035: Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer - IE 8 - Windows XP SP2 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS10-053. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows XP SP2/SP3, it now only applies to Windows XP SP2.</P> <P>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS10-035. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves five privately reported vulnerabilities and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This security update is also referenced under KB982381.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
