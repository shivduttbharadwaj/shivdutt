		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS10-014. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<br /><br />Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow denial of service if a specially crafted ticket renewal request is sent to the Windows Kerberos domain from an authenticated user on a trusted non-Windows Kerberos realm. The denial of service could persist until the domain controller is restarted.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
