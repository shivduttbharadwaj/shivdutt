		<Title>MS07-040: Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Remote Code Execution - .NET Framework 2.0 - Windows 2000/XP/2003</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a patch that resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities. Two of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution on client systems with .NET Framework installed, and one could allow information disclosure on Web servers running ASP.NET. In all remote code execution cases, users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that the update for this issue may be included in a future update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR> <P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Important Note:</STRONG></FONT><FONT color=#000000> BigFix has received reports of various issues associated with the deployment of this patch. Please take extra caution to qualify this update in a test environment prior to use in a production environment.</FONT></P><P><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB928365.</P><P><B>Note:</B> This Fixlet message does not have a default action.
