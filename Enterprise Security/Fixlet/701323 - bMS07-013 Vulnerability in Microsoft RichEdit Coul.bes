		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P>Microsoft has released a security patch for Learning Essentials for Microsoft Office. This update resolves&nbsp;a newly-discovered, privately reported vulnerability. On vulnerable versions of Office, if a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client workstation.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled. <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Some Office updates will <B>force</B> the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update. </P><P><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB929437.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
