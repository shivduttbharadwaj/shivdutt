		<Title>MS06-047: Vulnerability in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Microsoft VBA</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<b>Note: </b>This Fixlet has been partially superseded by MS10-031. Whereas it used to apply to VBA SDK 6.0, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4, it now only applies to VBA SDK 6.0 and 6.2.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a security patch for Visual Basic for Applications. This update resolves several newly-discovered, privately reported and public vulnerabilities. On vulnerable versions of Visual Basic for Applications, if a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client workstation. <BR><BR>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This security update is also referenced under KB923167.
