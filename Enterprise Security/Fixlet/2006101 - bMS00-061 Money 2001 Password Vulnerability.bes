		<Title>MS00-061: Money 2001 Password Vulnerability</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
Microsoft Money provides a password protection feature that prevents unauthorized access to your Money file. However, due to the way the password is currently handled, the password may be written in plaintext under certain conditions. The vulnerability only affects Money data stored on the user's local computer - it does not affect the security of Money's online services in any way. Moreover, a malicious user would need to gain physical access to an affected file in order to exploit the vulnerability - it could not be exploited remotely. It's important to note that password protection in Money is not intended to be a substitute for file-level access control, and even in the absence of this vulnerability, customers need to protect such files. Microsoft recommends that computer users follow best practices when securing their systems, including ensuring that machines with important data are physically secure, and not sharing important data files with untrusted or unknown sources.<BR><BR><b>Note</b>: Microsoft has not made this patch available for general download. In order to close this vulnerability, users of affected computers should open Microsoft Money, select the "Tools" menu, and then select "Update Internet Information." This procedure may need to be executed multiple times before the program will be fully updated and the Fixlet message will disappear.<BR><BR><b>Note</b>: To follow best practices, users should change their passwords after applying this patch.<BR><BR><b>Note</b>: If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This Fixlet message does not have a default action. For more information on default actions, see BigFix KB #474.
