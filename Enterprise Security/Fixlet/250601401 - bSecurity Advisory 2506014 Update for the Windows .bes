<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P>Microsoft is announcing the availability of an update to winload.exe to address an issue in driver signing enforcement. While this is not an issue that would require a security update, this update addresses a method by which unsigned drivers could be loaded by winload.exe. This technique is often utilized by malware to stay resident on a system after the initial infection.</P> <P>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><B></B></P> <P><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2506014. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
