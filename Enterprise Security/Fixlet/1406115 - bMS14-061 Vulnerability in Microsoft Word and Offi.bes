		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS14-081. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to SharePoint Server 2010 SP1 / SP2 (x64), it now only applies to SharePoint Server 2010 SP1 (x64).</P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if an attacker convinces a user to open a specially crafted Microsoft Word file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2883098.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
