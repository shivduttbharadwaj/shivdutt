		<Title>MS12-074: Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Remote Code Execution - .NET Framework 3.5 - Windows 8</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves five privately reported vulnerabilities in the .NET Framework. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker convinces the user of a target system to use a malicious proxy auto configuration file and then injects code into the currently running application.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2729462.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
