		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The vulnerability could allow denial of service if an attacker sends a small number of specially crafted requests to an affected .NET-enabled website. By default, ASP.NET is not installed when Microsoft .NET Framework is installed on any supported edition of Microsoft Windows. To be affected by the vulnerability, customers must manually install and enable ASP.NET by registering it with IIS.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2977766.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
