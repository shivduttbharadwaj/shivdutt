		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating security vulnerabilities in a Windows Media Player Plugin. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights <BR><BR>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR><B>Note: </B>Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup. <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Important Note:</STRONG></FONT> There are known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Caveats section of the security bulletin for more information.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
