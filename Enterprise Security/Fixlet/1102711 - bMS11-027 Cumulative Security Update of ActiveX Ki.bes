		<Title>MS11-027: Cumulative Security Update of ActiveX Kill Bits - Windows Vista SP1 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS11-090. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows&nbsp;Vista SP1/SP2 (x64), it now only applies to Windows Vista SP1 (x64).</P> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft software. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page that instantiates a specific ActiveX control with Internet Explorer. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. This update also includes kill bits for three third-party ActiveX controls.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
