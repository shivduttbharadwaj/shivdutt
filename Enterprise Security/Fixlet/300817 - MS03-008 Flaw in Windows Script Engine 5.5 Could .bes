		<Title>MS03-008: Flaw in Windows Script Engine 5.5 Could Allow Code Execution - Windows 2000</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a security vulnerability in the Windows Script Engine. The Windows Script Engine provides the ability to execute script code. Script code can be used to add functionality to web pages, or to automate tasks within the operating system or within a program. A flaw exists in the way by which the Windows Script Engine for JScript processes information. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a web page that, when visited by the user, would execute code of the attacker's choice with the user's privileges. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers will report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but the vulnerability will not be closed until the affected computer is restarted.<BR><BR><b>File Size: </b>345 KB<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This Fixlet message does not have a default action. For more information on default actions, see BigFix KB #474.
