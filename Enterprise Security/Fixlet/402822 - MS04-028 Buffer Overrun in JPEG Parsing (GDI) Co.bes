Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a security vulnerability in the processing of JPEG image formats that could allow remote code execution. The affected component, GDI+, is a graphics device interface that is used in nearly all .NET Framework applications. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><STRONG></STRONG></FONT><BR><FONT size=2><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The standalone security update (fixlet message #402828) eliminates the same vulnerability.</FONT><BR><FONT size=2><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note: </FONT></B>Taking the&nbsp;action&nbsp;below will deploy .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1.
