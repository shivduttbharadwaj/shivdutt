<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a vulnerability in the WordPerfect document converter. The converter has an unchecked buffer which could result in an malicious user crafting a WordPerfect document that could allow the user to execute arbitrary code if an application that used the WordPerfect converter opened the document. Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, FrontPage, Publisher, and the Microsoft Works Suite can all use the WordPerfect converter. After installation of this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><b>Note:</b> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.<br><br><b>Note:</b> In preparation for deploying this update through an Administrative Installation Point, you must apply this patch to all Administrative Installation Points in your network. For instructions on how to install this patch to your Administrative Installation Point, see the 'Security Update' section of the security bulletin.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Some Office updates will <b>force</b> the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update.cations prior to applying this update.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB873380.<br><br><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for the Fixlet message because it requires additional preparation before deployment.
