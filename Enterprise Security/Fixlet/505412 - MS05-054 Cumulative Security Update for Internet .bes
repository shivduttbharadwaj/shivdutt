<DIV class=FixletMessage>
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS05-054.

Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a cumulative patch for Internet Explorer that eliminates newly discovered security vulnerabilities, as well as eliminating all vulnerabilities covered by earlier patches. Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><b><BR>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><b><BR>Important Note:</b> This update includes IE hotfixes that have been released since MS04-004 or MS04-025, but they will only be installed on systems that need them.
