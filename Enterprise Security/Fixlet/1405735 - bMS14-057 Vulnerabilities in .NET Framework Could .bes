		<Title>MS14-057: Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows 7 SP1 - .NET Framework 3.5.1 - KB2968294</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft .NET Framework. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker sends a specially crafted URI request containing international characters to a .NET web application. In .NET 4.0 applications, the vulnerable functionality (iriParsing) is disabled by default; for the vulnerability to be exploitable an application has to explicitly enable this functionality. In .NET 4.5 applications, iriParsing is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2968294.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
