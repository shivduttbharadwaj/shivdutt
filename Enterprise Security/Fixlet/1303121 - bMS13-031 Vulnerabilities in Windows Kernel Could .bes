		<Title>MS13-031: Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - Windows Server 2008 R2 Gold (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Note: This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS13-063. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows Server 2008 R2 Gold/SP1&nbsp;(x64), it now only applies to Windows&nbsp;Server 2008 R2 Gold&nbsp;(x64).<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to the system and runs a specially crafted application. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2813170.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
