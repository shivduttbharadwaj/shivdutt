<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><FONT size=2>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS06-021. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.</FONT></P> <P>Microsoft has released a cumulative patch for Internet Explorer that resolves several newly-discovered, publicly and privately reported vulnerabilities, as well as eliminating all vulnerabilities covered by earlier patches. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately. <BR><BR>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><STRONG>Important Note:</STRONG> Microsoft recommends that you deploy this update at the same time as the MS06-023 update. Please see the "Caveats" section of the security bulletin for more information. </P> <P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></STRONG> There are several known issues associated with the installation of this patch.
