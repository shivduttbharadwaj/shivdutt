		<Title>MS08-013: Vulnerability in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Office 2000 - Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 (Network Installation)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security patch for Office 2000. This critical security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file with a malformed object inserted into the document. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.<br><br>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <br><br><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that the update for this issue may be included in a future update rollup. <br><br><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <br><br><b>Note:</b> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled. <br><br><b>Note:</b> Some Office updates will <b>force</b> the affected computer to restart without displaying a warning message if Office applications are open when this update is run. To prevent this from happening, shut down all Office applications prior to applying this update. <br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB944425.<br><br><B>Note:</B> There is no default action for the Fixlet message because it requires additional preparation before deployment. For more information on default actions, see BigFix KB #474.<br><br><div class="HideFromWebUI"><b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.</div></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
