<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS10-094. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows&nbsp;2003 Gold/SP2 (x64), it now only applies to Windows 2003 Gold (x64).</P> <P>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS08-053. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.</P> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Windows Media Encoder 9 Series. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Web page. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR></P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Microsoft has announced that this update will <STRONG>not</STRONG>&nbsp;be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
