		<Title>MS07-034: Cumulative Security Update for Outlook Express and Windows Mail - Windows XP/2003 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P>Microsoft has released a patch that resolves two newly discovered, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. One of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted e-mail using Windows Mail in Windows Vista. The other vulnerabilities could allow information disclosure if a user visits a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer and cannot be exploited directly in Outlook Express. For the information disclosure vulnerabilities, users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. </P> <P>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.</P> <P><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P> <P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are several known issues associated with the installation of this patch. See the Known Issues&nbsp; section of the security bulletin for more information.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
