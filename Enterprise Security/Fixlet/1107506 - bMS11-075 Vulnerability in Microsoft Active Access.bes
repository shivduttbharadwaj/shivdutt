		<Title>MS11-075: Vulnerability in Microsoft Active Accessibility Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows Server 2003 SP2 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS11-075. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<br /><br />Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the Microsoft Active Accessibility component. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if an attacker convinces a user to open a legitimate file that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file. Then, while opening the legitimate file, the Microsoft Active Accessibility component could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained. For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a document from this location that is then loaded by a vulnerable application.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2564958.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
