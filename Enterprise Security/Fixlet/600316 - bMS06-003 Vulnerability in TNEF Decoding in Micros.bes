<DIV class=FixletMessage>
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS06-003. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating security vulnerabilities in Exchange 5.0. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute code on an affected system. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><b>Important Note:</b> This update may restart several services including IIS, SMTP, and the Exchange Server Information Store Service. Please schedule the update to occur at a time when a service interruption is acceptable.<BR><BR><b>Important Note:</b> Reinstallation of this patch can fail under different circumstances. If affected computers report back "Failed" for this action, the patch may have to be reinstalled manually. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This security update is also referenced under KB894689.
