		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><p><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This update has been superseded by KB4345592.<br /><br />This security update resolves the following vulnerabilities:</p><br><br><ul><br>	<li><span><span>A &quot;remote code execution&quot; vulnerability exists when .NET Framework does not validate input correctly. An attacker who successfully exploits&nbsp;this vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts that have full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who have administrative user rights. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to pass specific input to an application through susceptible .NET Framework methods. This security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Framework validates input. To learn more about this vulnerability, see <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8284">Microsoft Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE-2018-8284</a>.</span></span></li><br>	<li><span><span>An &quot;elevation of privilege&quot; vulnerability exists in .NET Framework that could allow an attacker to elevate their user rights level. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to access the local computer, and then run a malicious program. This update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Framework enables COM objects. To learn more about this vulnerability, see <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8202">Microsoft Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE-2018-8202</a>.</span></span></li><br>	<li><span><span>A &quot;security feature bypass&quot; vulnerability exists when .NET Framework components do not correctly validate certificates. An attacker could present expired certificates when challenged. This security update addresses the vulnerability by making sure that .NET Framework components correctly validate certificates. To learn more about this vulnerability, see <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8356">Microsoft Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE-2018-8356</a>.</span></span></li><br></ul><br><p><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.</p><p><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.</p><p><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB4340558.</p></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
