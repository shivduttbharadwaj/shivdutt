		<Title>MS09-012: Vulnerabilities in Windows Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - Windows Service Isolation - Windows Server 2008 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves four publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker is allowed to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application. The attacker must be able to run code on the local machine in order to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control over the affected system.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB956572.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
