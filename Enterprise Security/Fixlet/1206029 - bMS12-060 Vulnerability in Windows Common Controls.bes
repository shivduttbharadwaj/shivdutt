		<Title>MS12-060: Vulnerability in Windows Common Controls Could Allow Remote Code Execution - SQL Server 2000 SP4 - QFE Branch</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Windows common controls. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user visits a website containing specially crafted content designed to exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit such a website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website. The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment as well, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.</P> <P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></STRONG> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB983811.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
