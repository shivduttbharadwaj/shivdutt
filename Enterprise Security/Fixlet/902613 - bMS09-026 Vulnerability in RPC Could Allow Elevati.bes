		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Note: This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS13-062. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows Vista Gold/SP1/SP2 (x64), it now only applies to Windows Vista Gold/SP1 (x64).<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in the Windows remote procedure call (RPC) facility where the RPC Marshalling Engine does not update its internal state appropriately. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. Supported editions of Microsoft Windows are not delivered with any RPC servers or clients that are subject to exploitation of this vulnerability. In a default configuration, users could not be attacked by exploitation of this vulnerability. However, the vulnerability is present in the Microsoft Windows RPC runtime and could affect third-party RPC applications.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
