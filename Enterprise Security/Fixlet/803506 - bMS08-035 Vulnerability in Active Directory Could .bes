Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in implementations of Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) when installed on Windows XP Professional.
