		<Title>MS08-036: Vulnerabilities in Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) Could Allow Denial of Service - Windows Vista Gold/SP1</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in the Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) protocol that could allow a denial of service if malformed PGM packets are received by an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a user's system to become non-responsive and to require a restart to restore functionality. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></STRONG> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update&nbsp;will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
