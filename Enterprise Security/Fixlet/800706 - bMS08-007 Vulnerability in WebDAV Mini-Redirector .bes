<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS15-008. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows Server 2003 SP1 / SP2, it now only applies to Windows Server 2003 SP1.</P>The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS08-007. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<br /><br />Microsoft has released a critical security update that resolves one privately reported vulnerability in the WebDAV Mini-Redirector. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update&nbsp;will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
