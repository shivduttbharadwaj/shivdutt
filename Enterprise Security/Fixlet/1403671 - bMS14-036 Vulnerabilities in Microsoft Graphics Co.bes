		<Title>MS14-036: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Graphics Component Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Lync Basic 2013 Gold / Lync 2013 Gold - KB2881013 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This patch has been partially superseded by MS15-044. Whereas this Fixlet previously applied to Lync Basic 2013 Gold/SP1 / Lync 2013 Gold/SP1 (x64), it now only applies to Lync Basic 2013 Gold / Lync 2013 Gold (x64).</P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Lync. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted file or webpage. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2881013.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
