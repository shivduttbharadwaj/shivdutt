		<Title>MS15-041: Vulnerability in .NET Framework Could Allow Information Disclosure - Windows 7 SP1 / Windows Server 2008 SP2 / Windows Vista SP2 - .NET Framework 4.5/4.5.1/4.5.2 - KB3037581</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if an attacker sends a specially crafted web request to an affected server that has custom error messages disabled. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability would be able to view parts of a web configuration file, which could expose sensitive information.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3037581.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
