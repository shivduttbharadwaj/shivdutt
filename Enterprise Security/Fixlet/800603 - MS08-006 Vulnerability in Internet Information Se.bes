		<Title>MS08-006: Vulnerability in Internet Information Services Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows XP Gold (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS10-065. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Windows XP Gold/SP2 (x64), it now only applies to Windows XP Gold (x64). </P> <P>Microsoft has released an important update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Internet Information Services (IIS). A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that IIS handles input to ASP Web pages. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then perform actions on the IIS server with the same rights as the Worker Process Identity (WPI). The WPI is configured with Network Service account privileges by default. IIS servers with ASP pages whose application pools are configured with a WPI that uses an account with administrative privileges could be more seriously impacted than IIS servers whose application pool is configured with the default WPI settings.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
