See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><STRONG>Note: </STRONG>This security update is also referenced under KB981997.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
