		<Title>MS15-082: Vulnerabilities in RDP Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Windows 7 SP1 - KB3075220 (x64) (Superseded)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This update has been superseded by KB4507456.<br><br>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker first places a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file in the target user's current working directory and then convinces the user to open a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) file or to launch a program that is designed to load a trusted DLL file but instead loads the attacker's specially crafted DLL file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3075220.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
