		<Title>MS01-056: "Unchecked Buffer" in Windows Media Player .ASF Processor</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in the .ASF Processor in Windows Media Player. Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) is a streaming media format supported by Windows Media Player. According to Microsoft, a vulnerability in the .ASF Processor could allow a malicious ASF file to cause Media Player to crash or allow an attacker to run code on the user's computer. After downloading and installing this patch, relevant computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. <BR><BR>This patch addresses the .ASF Buffer security vulnerability, as well as all known vulnerabilities in Media Player version 6.4. Since Microsoft has included some Media Player version 6.4 components affected by these vulnerabilities in later versions of Media Player, Microsoft recommends that all users with Media Player versions 6.4, 7.0 and 7.1 download this patch. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers will report back as 'Fixed' once the patch has run successfully, but the vulnerability will not be closed until the affected computer is restarted.<BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 780 KB
