		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS05-029. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers.<BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a cross-site scripting and spoofing vulnerability existing in the Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server 5.5. If successfully exploited, an attacker could perform cross-site scripting attacks. After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update. <BR><BR><b>Important Note:</b> This update may restart several services including IIS, the Exchange Store, and the Exchange System Attendant Services. Please schedule the update to occur at a time when a service interruption is acceptable.
