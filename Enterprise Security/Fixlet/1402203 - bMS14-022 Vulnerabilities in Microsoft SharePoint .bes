Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to Project Server 2013 Gold/SP1 (x64), it now only applies to Project Server 2013 Gold (x64).</P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves multiple privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office server and productivity software. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an authenticated attacker sends specially crafted page content to a target SharePoint server.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2760236.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
