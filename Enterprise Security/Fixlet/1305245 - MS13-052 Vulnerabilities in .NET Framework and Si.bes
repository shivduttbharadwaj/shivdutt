		<Title>MS13-052: Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework and Silverlight Could Allow Remote Code Execution - .NET Framework 4.5 - Windows Vista SP2 / 2008 SP2 / 7 SP1 (KB2840642) (V2.0)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves five privately reported vulnerabilities and two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft .NET Framework and Microsoft Silverlight. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a trusted application uses a particular pattern of code. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2840642.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
