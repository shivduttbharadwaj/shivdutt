		<Title>MS09-017: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office PowerPoint Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats SP1 (Superseded)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>This update has been superseded because Microsoft has stopped offering the deployed binary.<br /><br /><STRONG>Note: </STRONG>This bulletin has been partially superseded by MS11-022. Whereas this Fixlet message previously applied to&nbsp;Office Compatibility Pack 2007&nbsp;SP1/SP2, it now only applies to&nbsp;&nbsp;Office Compatibility Pack 2007&nbsp;SP1.</P> <P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability and several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office PowerPoint that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted PowerPoint file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Important Note:</FONT></B> There are known issues associated with the installation of this update. See the Known Issues section of the security bulletin for more information.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update&nbsp;will be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB969618.<BR><BR></P> <P><B>Note:</B> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.</P> <P><SPAN id=dashboardLink></SPAN> <SCRIPT type=text/javascript>var isEvansOrLater = '<?relevance if (exists property "datastore inspectors") then (True) else (False)?>' == 'True'?true:false; document.body.onload = SetOfficeOverviewLink; function SetOfficeOverviewLink() { try {if (isEvansOrLater) { dashboardLink.innerHTML = Relevance('(format "<?rxlat <b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the {0}.?>" + link "<?rxlat Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard?>" of bes wizard whose (dashboard id of it = "office_overview.ojo" AND id of site of it = 2) as string ) as string');} else { dashboardLink.innerHTML = EvaluateRelevance('"<b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the " & link "Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard" of bes wizard whose (dashboard id of it = "office_overview.ojo" AND id of site of it = 2) as string & "."');} } catch (e) {if (isEvansOrLater) { dashboardLink.innerHTML ='<?jxlat <b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.?>';} else { dashboardLink.innerHTML = '<b>Note:</b> For configuration controls and an overview of your Microsoft Office deployment(s), please see the Microsoft Office Overview Dashboard.';} } } </SCRIPT> </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
