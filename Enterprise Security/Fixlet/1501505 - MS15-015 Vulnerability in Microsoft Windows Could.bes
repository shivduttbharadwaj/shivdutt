		<Title>MS15-015: Vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 - KB3031432 (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to leverage the lack of impersonation-level security checks to elevate privileges during process creation. An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could acquire administrator credentials and use them to elevate privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> To deploy this Fixlet, ensure that Windows Update service is not disabled.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB3031432.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
