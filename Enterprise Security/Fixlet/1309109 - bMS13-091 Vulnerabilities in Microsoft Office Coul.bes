		<Title>MS13-091: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Office 2010 SP1 (file format converters)(2553284) (x64)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This patch has been partially superseded by MS15-059. Whereas this Fixlet previously applied to Office 2010 SP1/SP2 (x64), it now only applies to Office 2010 SP1 (x64).</P>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a specially crafted WordPerfect document file is opened in an affected version of Microsoft Office software. An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2553284.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
