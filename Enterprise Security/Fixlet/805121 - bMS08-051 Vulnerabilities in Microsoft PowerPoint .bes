		<Title>MS08-051: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft PowerPoint Could Allow Remote Code Execution - Office 2007 Gold (Superseded)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>This update has been superseded because Microsoft has stopped offering the deployed binary.<br /><br />Microsoft has released a security update that resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office PowerPoint and Microsoft Office PowerPoint Viewer that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted PowerPoint file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future update rollup.<BR><BR><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This security update is also referenced under KB951338.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
