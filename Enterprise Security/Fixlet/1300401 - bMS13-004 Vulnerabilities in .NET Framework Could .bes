		<Title>MS13-004: Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - .NET Framework 1.0 SP3 - Tablet PC/Media Center Edition</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>Microsoft has released a security update that resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities in the .NET Framework. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user views a specially crafted webpage using a web browser that can run XAML Browser Applications (XBAPs). The vulnerabilities could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.<br><br>After downloading and installing this update, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the update has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<br><br><B>Note:</B> Microsoft has announced that this update may be included in a future service pack or update rollup.<br><br><B>Note:</B> This security update is also referenced under KB2742607.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
