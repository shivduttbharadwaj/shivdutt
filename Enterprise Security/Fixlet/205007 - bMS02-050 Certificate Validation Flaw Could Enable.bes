		<Title>MS02-050: Certificate Validation Flaw Could Enable Identity Spoofing in Windows 98</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
Microsoft has released a security bulletin outlining a flaw in validation of digital certificates. This flaw would allow an attacker to create a phony certificate which would be accepted as valid. Microsoft recommends that all affected computers apply this patch. <BR><BR><b>Note</b>: Once this Fixlet has completed its action, affected computers will report back 'Pending Restart', as the vulnerability will not yet be closed. Once the computer has been restarted, it will report its final status.<BR><BR><b>Note</b>: Client machines may briefly display progress windows during installation of this update. The update will ask users on client machines if they want to reboot following installation.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This patch was re-released on November 20, 2002, to fix a number of issues. Microsoft recommends that all affected machines install the new version of the patch. Due to the manner in which the original patch was implemented, adding, removing or modifying hardware on your systems may have resulted in the display of warning messages stating hardware drivers have not passed Windows Logo testing even though in reality they actually may have. This new patch fixes that issue, and also fixes a newly discovered variant of the vulnerability. <BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 407 KB<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> This Fixlet message does not have a default action. For more information on default actions, see BigFix KB #474.
