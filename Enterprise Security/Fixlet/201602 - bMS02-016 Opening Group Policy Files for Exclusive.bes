		<Title>MS02-016: Opening Group Policy Files for Exclusive Read Blocks Policy Application - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS bulletin MS02-016. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>The vulnerability results from the ability to lock Group Policy files, thereby preventing users from reading them or applying new policy settings to a user's session. After downloading and installing the patch, the affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability. <BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers will report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but the vulnerability will not be closed until the affected computer is restarted.<BR><BR><b>File Size:</b> 4.06 MB
