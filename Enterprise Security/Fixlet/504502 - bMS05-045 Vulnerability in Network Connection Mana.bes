		<Title>MS05-045: Vulnerability in Network Connection Manager Could Allow Denial of Service - Windows Server 2003 - CORRUPT PATCH</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<DIV class=FixletMessage>
The listed computers have faulty installations of a patch for the vulnerability described in MS05-045. Some files being used by these computers have versions earlier than those of the corresponding files installed by the patch. Services or applications installed after the patch was distributed may have overwritten the files, or the initial installation may have been faulty. We recommend reinstalling this patch to ensure the safety of affected computers. <BR><BR>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a denial of service vulnerability in Network connection manager, which could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted network packet to an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the component responsible for managing network and remote access connections to stop responding. If the affected component is stopped due to an attack, it will automatically restart when new requests are received.<BR><BR>After downloading and installing this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Affected computers may report back as 'Pending Restart' once the patch has run successfully, but will not report back their final status until the computer has been restarted.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has announced that this patch will be included in future Service Pack or Update Rollup.
