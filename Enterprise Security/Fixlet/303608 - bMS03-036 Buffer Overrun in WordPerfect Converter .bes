		<Title>MS03-036: Buffer Overrun in WordPerfect Converter Could Allow Code Execution - Office 2000 Applications - Windows 2000/NT/XP (Administrative Installation)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><FONT size=2>Microsoft has released a patch eliminating a vulnerability in the WordPerfect document converter.  The converter has an unchecked buffer which could result in an malicious user crafting a WordPerfect document that could allow the user to execute arbitrary code if an application that used the WordPerfect converter opened the document.  Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, FrontPage, Publisher, and the Microsoft Works Suite can all use the WordPerfect converter.  After installation of this patch, affected computers will no longer be susceptible to this vulnerability. </P> <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If this patch has already been installed on computers reporting relevant, it means that one or more files updated by the patch have been downgraded to unsafe versions. In order to ensure security, it is recommended that the patch be reinstalled.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>Note: </STRONG>In preparation for deploying this update through an Administrative Installation Point, you must apply this patch to all Administrative Installation Points in your network. For instructions on how to install this patch to your Administrative Installation Point, please browse to the following link: <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/xp/journ/wpft0901a.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/xp/journ/wpft0901a.htm</A><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/xp/journ/wpft1001a.htm"></A><A href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=824936"></A></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=2>.
