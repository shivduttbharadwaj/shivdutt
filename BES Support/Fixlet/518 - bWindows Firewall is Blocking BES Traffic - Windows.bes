<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P><FONT size=2>The listed computers have the Windows Firewall enabled. Windows Firewall is currently configured to block inbound UDP traffic on the port used by BES (BES uses port 52311 by default) as well as inbound ICMP traffic. <BR><BR>The BES Server and BES Relays send UDP packets to the BES Clients to notify them that there is new information available such as new Fixlet messages, actions, and computer refreshes. BES Clients on relevant computers will not receive UDP notification packets and therefore will not see new actions or new Fixlet messages until they gather the new actionsite, which is by default, once a day. After configuring Windows Firewall to allow inbound UDP traffic on the BES Listen Port, BES Clients will resume normal communication with the BES Server and BES Relays. ICMP is used in during the BES Relay selection process.<BR><BR><B>Note:</B> After this action is applied, affected BES Clients will not report until they have performed their standard once-per-day gather or until the BES Client is restarted.</FONT><FONT size=2><BR><BR><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Important Note:</STRONG></FONT>&nbsp;If the listed computers' firewall settings are being administered through a domain group policy, the results of this action may be overwritten by that policy. The actions below will only affect the local firewall policy, and will not affect any group firewall policy settings that may have been applied by a domain administrator. If your firewall has been configured via a domain group policy, these actions may report back as 'Failed', and the firewall must be disabled or configured through group policy instead.</FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#ff0000><FONT size=2><STRONG>Important Note: </STRONG><FONT color=#000000>This Fixlet doesn't perform any check if the computer is configured with more than one active Firewall Profile and it will always be not relevant.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P> <P>&nbsp;</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
