		<Title>TROUBLESHOOTING: Repair invalid Site Subscriptions</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P dir=ltr>This fixlet checks the subscription actions of the external sites enabled in your deployment and shows as relevant if any of those sites has become invalid.</P><P dir=ltr>By taking the default action, the agent running on your IBM endpoint Manager Root Server will download an utility that remediates this issue. The utility will connect to the IBM endpoint Manager Root Server database, discover invalid subscription actions and regenerate them.</P><P dir=ltr>The final fix to this problem will be available in upcoming patch releases for IBM Endpoint Manager 9.1 and 9.2.</P><P dir=ltr><STRONG><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Important Note:</SPAN></STRONG> The remediation action does not support deployments having the BES Root Server running under an&nbsp; account different than LocalSystem. In such a situation, please refer to the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21689022">technote describing this problem</a> for the sequence of manual steps required to solve this issue.</P><P dir=ltr><STRONG><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Important Note:</SPAN></STRONG> In a DSA environment, it is enough to take the action on the main server, even if the fixlet becomes relevant also for all replica servers. Target this action to the specific endpoint representing the main server rather than through a property or other dynamic targeting.</P><BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
