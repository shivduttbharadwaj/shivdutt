		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers have a pending operation scheduled in the registry under the <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</b> key. This pending operation is scheduled to be run the next time an administrative user logs into the operating system. <BR><BR>Usually, the pending operations are required to complete an installation that requires a restart. A user should log on to these computers as soon as possible in order to ensure that all patches and applications install completely.<BR><BR><b>Note:</b> Installations and patches that require a user to login usually require that the user have administrative privileges to complete the installation. If a user does not have administrative privileges, they may receive a warning when they log in that they have insufficient privileges to finish the installation.&nbsp;
