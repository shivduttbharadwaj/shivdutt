		<Title>BES Clients Cannot Find a Nearby BES Relay because ICMP is Blocked</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD> <P>The listed computers have BES Clients which are using automatic BES Relay selection.&nbsp; Automatic BES Relay&nbsp;selection&nbsp;attempts to find the closest BES Relay based&nbsp;upon the number of network hops to each BES Relay. </P> <P>However, the BES Clients&nbsp;are unable to determine how far away the BES Relays are because the protocol used to determine the number of network hops (ICMP) is blocked on the network path between the BES Client and every BES Relay.</P> <P>As a result, the BES Clients have randomly chosen a BES Relay to report to. In some cases, such as very fast networks, this is not necessarily a problem, but if there are slow network connections in your network, the BES Client might have randomly chosen a very poor BES Relay because the network path might involve&nbsp;a slow connection.</P> <P>There are several steps you can take to resolve this issue: <UL> <LI>Add a BES Relay to the local subnet so the BES Client can find the BES Relay (it is very rare to find ICMP blocked on a local subnet). <LI>Manually assign the BES Clients to the appropriate BES Relays. <LI>Turn on ICMP between the BES Clients and BES Relays. <LI>Ignore this issue if you don't feel it causes concern because of your network structure (i.e., all network connections are high-speed).</LI></UL> <P>Below are links for more information and an option that will lock BES Clients so that they cannot download files. Turn on locking for BES Clients if you are concerned that this issue might cause network bandwidth problems during an action.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
