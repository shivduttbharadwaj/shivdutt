<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><FONT size=2>You appear to have more BES Clients on your network than your license allows. The computers listed are operating in "grace mode", which means that their license number is higher than allowed by your license but lower than the threshold at which they will stop functioning. <BR><BR>This situation may occur if you are in the process of uninstalling and reinstalling BES Clients, in which case the license numbers for the uninstalled BES Clients may not yet have been released, or it may be because you are actively running more clients than allowed by your license. If the latter is the case, you should contact BigFix immediately (<A href="mailto:TEM@dk.ibm.com">TEM@dk.ibm.com</A>)&nbsp;to obtain a larger license. </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
