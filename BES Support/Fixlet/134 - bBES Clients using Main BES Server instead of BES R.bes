		<Title>BES Clients using Main BES Server instead of BES Relay - Manual Selection (Primary BES Relay Not Set)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers are reporting directly to the main BES Server instead of using a BES Relay. This is not necessarily a problem, but if there are too many BES Clients pointing to the BES Server, you may see performance issues.<BR><BR>In particular, the BES Clients may appear "sluggish" when reporting their results during an action. This may occur if there are too many BES Clients attempting to gather, download files, and send results to the BES Server. In this case, some of these connection requests will be rejected if the BES Server is too busy. <BR><BR>The BES Clients listed are using manual BES Relay selection, but the primary BES Relay is not set.<BR><BR>To address this issue, you should either set the BES Clients to automatically select their closest BES Relay based on network hops or manually select the BES Relay for the BES Clients. Both of these options require that you first have at least one BES Relay installed.
