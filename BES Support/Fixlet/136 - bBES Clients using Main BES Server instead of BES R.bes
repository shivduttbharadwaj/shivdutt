		<Title>BES Clients using Main BES Server instead of BES Relay - Manual Selection (Primary BES Relay Set)</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
The listed computers are reporting directly to the main BES Server instead of using a BES Relay. This is not necessarily a problem, but if there are too many BES Clients pointing to the BES Server, you may see performance issues with BES.<BR><BR>In particular, the BES Clients may appear "sluggish" when reporting their results during an action.&nbsp; This may occur if there are too many BES Clients attempting to gather, download files, and send results to the BES Server.&nbsp; In this case, some of these connection requests will be rejected if the BES Server is too busy.<BR><BR>The BES Clients on the computers listed are using manual BES Relay selection and although the primary BES Relay is set, the BES Client is not correctly using the BES Relay. To address this issue, you need to figure out why the BES Clients are unable to use the designated BES Relay. This issue might be caused by the BES Relay not functioning properly or the BES Clients not being able to resolve the DNS name of the BES Relay.
