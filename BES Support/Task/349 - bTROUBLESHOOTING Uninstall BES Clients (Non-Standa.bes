		<Description><![CDATA[
<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><FONT face=verdana size=2> <P>If you want to remove the BES Clients from a computer, you&nbsp;can&nbsp;uninstall it using this&nbsp;task.</P> <P> <LI><STRONG>Uninstall&nbsp;the BES Client</STRONG> - this&nbsp;removes the BES Client application, but will leave behind&nbsp;configuration options, settings, and other traces of the application. This&nbsp;will allows you to reinstall&nbsp;the BES Client&nbsp;at a later time and keep&nbsp;the same computer ID and configuration. <P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> You are not able to completely remove all traces of the BES Client because the client was not installed in a folder named "Enterprise Client" or "BES Client".&nbsp;This is a safety precaution&nbsp;to protect against erasing valuable&nbsp;data not associated with the BES Client.&nbsp;<BR><BR><FONT size=2><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This task will not report relevant on the BES Server and BES Relays. To remove the BES Client on a BES Relay, you must first uninstall the BES Relay using the appropriate BES Relay uninstall task.</P></FONT> <P><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>Important Note:</FONT></STRONG> The BES Clients will not be able to report the final status of the action because they&nbsp;will be removed before the action completes. Instead, the BES Clients will stop responding and the action status will report back as 'Evaluating', 'Failed',&nbsp;or 'Running'. You will need to manually remove the computer from the BES Console after the BES Client is uninstalled.<BR></P></FONT></LI></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
